List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'DynamicTrailerCouplingReferenceModel' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def VehicleFrame;\n\tpart def HitchBall;\n\tpart def Trailer;\n\tpart def TrailerFrame;\n\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart vehicleFrame : VehicleFrame {\n\t\t\tpart hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart trailer : Trailer {\n\t\tpart trailerFrame : TrailerFrame {\n\t\t\tpart coupler : TrailerCoupler {\n\t\t\t\tref part hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\t\t\n\t}\t\t\n\taction {\n\t\taction 'connect trailer to vehicle'\n\t\t\tassign trailer.trailerFrame.coupler.hitch := vehicle.vehicleFrame.hitch;\n\t\tthen action 'disconnect trailer from vehicle'\n\t\t\tassign trailer.trailerFrame.coupler.hitch := null;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerDynamicReference' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def TowBall;\n\tpart def VehicleChassis {\n\t\tpart towBall : TowBall;\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart chassis : VehicleChassis;\n\t}\n\tpart def TrailerChassis;\npart def CouplerMechanism {\n\tattribute isLatched : Boolean;\n}\n\tpart def Trailer {\n\t\tpart chassis : TrailerChassis;\n\t\tpart coupler : CouplerMechanism;\n\t}\n\tconnection def HitchReference {\n\t\tend towBall : TowBall[1];\n\t\tend coupler : CouplerMechanism[1];\n\t}\naction def HitchTrailer {\n\tin towBall : TowBall;\n\tin coupler : CouplerMechanism;\n}\naction def UnhitchTrailer {\n\tin coupler : CouplerMechanism;\n}\n\tpart hitchReferenceModel {\n\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tpart trailer : Trailer;\n\t\tconnection hitchLink : HitchReference {\n\t\t\tend towBall = vehicle.chassis.towBall;\n\t\t\tend coupler = trailer.coupler;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction hitch : HitchTrailer {\n\t\t\tin towBall = vehicle.chassis.towBall;\n\t\t\tin coupler = trailer.coupler;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction unhitch : UnhitchTrailer {\n\t\t\tin coupler = trailer.coupler;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
