List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'PhotographyWorkflow' {\n\titem def Scene;\n\titem def Image;\n\titem def Picture;\n\taction def Focus { in scene : Scene; out image : Image; }\n\taction def Shoot { in image: Image; out picture : Picture; }\t\t\t\n\taction def TakePicture {\n\t\tin item scene : Scene;\n\t\tout item picture : Picture;\n\t\taction focus: Focus {\n\t\t\tin item scene = TakePicture::scene;\n\t\t\tout item image;\n\t\t}\n\t\tflow from focus.image to shoot.image;\n\t\tthen action shoot: Shoot {\n\t\t\tin item;\n\t\t\tout item picture = TakePicture::picture;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'PhotographyWorkflowAutomation' {\n\titem def Scene;\n\titem def IntermediateImage;\n\titem def Photo;\n\taction def Focusing {\n\t\tin selectedScene : Scene;\n\t\tout intermediate : IntermediateImage;\n\t}\n\taction def Shooting {\n\t\tin focusedImage : IntermediateImage;\n\t\tout finalPhoto : Photo;\n\t}\n\tstate def 'Photography Workflow';\n\taction focusing : Focusing;\n\taction shooting : Shooting;\n\tstate 'photography workflow' : 'Photography Workflow' {\n\t\tentry action initial;\n\t\ttransition initial then focusingStep;\n\t\tstate focusingStep {\n\t\t\tdo focusing;\n\t\t}\n\t\ttransition 'focus-to-shoot'\n\t\t\tfirst focusingStep\n\t\t\tthen shootingStep;\n\t\tstate shootingStep {\n\t\t\tdo shooting;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart def PhotographySystem {\n\t\tperform action focusing : Focusing;\n\t\tperform action shooting : Shooting;\n\t\texhibit state workflow : 'Photography Workflow';\n\t}\n\tpart photographySession : PhotographySystem;\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
