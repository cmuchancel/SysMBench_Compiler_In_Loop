List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'FuelFlowManagement' {\n\tattribute def Temp;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTank {\n\t\tport fuelTankPort : FuelPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport engineFuelPort : ~FuelPort;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'FuelInterfaceManagement' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelSupplyInterface {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Real;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tport def FuelReceiveInterface {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Real;\n\t\tin item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tout item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTank {\n\t\tport supplyPort : FuelSupplyInterface;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport receivePort : FuelReceiveInterface;\n\t}\n\tpart fuelFlowSystem {\n\t\tpart tank : FuelTank;\n\t\tpart engine : Engine;\n\t\tflow of Fuel from tank.supplyPort.fuelSupply to engine.receivePort.fuelSupply;\n\t\tflow of Fuel from engine.receivePort.fuelReturn to tank.supplyPort.fuelReturn;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
