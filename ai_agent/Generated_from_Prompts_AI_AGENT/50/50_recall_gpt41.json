List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleLifecycleTemporalModel' {\n\tattribute def Date;\n\titem def Person;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\ttimeslice assembly;\n\t\tfirst assembly then delivery;\n\t\tsnapshot delivery {\n\t\t\tattribute deliveryDate : Date;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen timeslice ownership[0..*] ordered {\n\t\t\tsnapshot sale = start;\n\t\t\tref item owner : Person[1];\n\t\t\ttimeslice driven[0..*] {\n\t\t\t\tref item driver : Person[1];\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tsnapshot junked = done;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleLifecycleManagement' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tprivate import Time::*;\n\t\n\titem def OwnerInfo {\n\t\tattribute name : String;\n\t}\n\t\n\titem def DriverInfo {\n\t\tattribute name : String;\n\t}\n\t\n\tpart vehicleLifecycle {\n\t\tpart assemblyStage {\n\t\t\tattribute isAssembled : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart deliveryStage {\n\t\t\tattribute deliveredOn : Time::DateTime;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart ownershipHistory {\n\t\t\tpart ownershipRecord[*] ordered {\n\t\t\t\tattribute owner : OwnerInfo;\n\t\t\t\tpart driverRecord[*] ordered {\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute driver : DriverInfo;\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute drivingDate : Time::DateTime;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart scrappingStage {\n\t\t\tattribute isScrapped : Boolean;\n\t\t\tattribute scrappedOn : Time::DateTime;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
