  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleDefinition' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\t\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Cylinder;\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart eng : Engine {\n\t\t\tpart cyl : Cylinder[4..6];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart smallVehicle :> vehicle {\n\t\tpart redefines eng {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cyl[4];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart bigVehicle :> vehicle {\n\t\tpart redefines eng {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cyl[6];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleEngineConfiguration' {\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart engine : Engine;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tpart cylinders : Cylinder[4..6];\n\t}\n\tpart def Cylinder;\n\tpart def SmallVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart smallEngine : Engine redefines engine {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cylinders[4];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart def LargeVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart largeEngine : Engine redefines engine {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cylinders[6];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
