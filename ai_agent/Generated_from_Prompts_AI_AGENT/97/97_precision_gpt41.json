List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleDefinition' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\t\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Cylinder;\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart eng : Engine {\n\t\t\tpart cyl : Cylinder[4..6];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart smallVehicle :> vehicle {\n\t\tpart redefines eng {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cyl[4];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart bigVehicle :> vehicle {\n\t\tpart redefines eng {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cyl[6];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleEngineConfiguration' {\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart engine : Engine;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tpart cylinders : Cylinder[4..6];\n\t}\n\tpart def Cylinder;\n\tpart def SmallVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart smallEngine : Engine redefines engine {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cylinders[4];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart def LargeVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart largeEngine : Engine redefines engine {\n\t\t\tpart redefines cylinders[6];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
