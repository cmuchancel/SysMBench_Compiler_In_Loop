List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'LoopBasedCharging' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tattribute def BatteryCharged;\n\tpart battery;\n\tpart powerSystem;\n\taction def MonitorBattery { out charge : Real; }\n\taction def AddCharge { in charge : Real; }\n\taction def EndCharging;\n\taction def ChargeBattery {\n\t\tloop action charging {\n\t\t\taction monitor : MonitorBattery {\n\t\t\t\tout charge;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tthen if monitor.charge < 100 {\n\t\t\t\taction addCharge : AddCharge {\n\t\t\t\t\tin charge = monitor.charge;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\t\t\t\t\n\t\t} until charging.monitor.charge >= 100;\n\t\tthen action endCharging : EndCharging;\n\t\tthen done;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'BatteryChargingMonitoringSystem' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\taction def 'Monitor Battery Percentage' {\n\t\tout percentage : Real;\n\t}\n\taction def 'Replenish Battery' {\n\t\tin requiredPercentage : Real;\n\t}\n\taction def 'Stop Charging' {\n\t\tin finalPercentage : Real;\n\t}\n\taction 'monitor battery percentage': 'Monitor Battery Percentage';\n\taction 'replenish battery': 'Replenish Battery';\n\taction 'stop charging': 'Stop Charging';\n\tstate def 'Charging States' {\n\t\tentry action initial;\n\t\ttransition initial then monitoring;\n\t\tstate monitoring {\n\t\t\tdo 'monitor battery percentage';\n\t\t}\n\t\ttransition 'monitoring-charging'\n\t\t\tfirst monitoring\n\t\t\taccept when 'monitor battery percentage'.percentage < 100\n\t\t\tthen charging;\n\t\tstate charging {\n\t\t\tdo 'replenish battery';\n\t\t}\n\t\ttransition 'charging-monitoring'\n\t\t\tfirst charging\n\t\t\taccept when 'monitor battery percentage'.percentage < 100\n\t\t\tthen monitoring;\n\t\ttransition 'charging-complete'\n\t\t\tfirst charging\n\t\t\taccept when 'monitor battery percentage'.percentage >= 100\n\t\t\tthen complete;\n\t\tstate complete {\n\t\t\tdo 'stop charging';\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart def ChargingController {\n\t\tattribute batteryPercentage : Real;\n\t\tperform action 'monitor battery percentage': 'Monitor Battery Percentage';\n\t\tperform action 'replenish battery': 'Replenish Battery';\n\t\tperform action 'stop charging': 'Stop Charging';\n\t\texhibit state 'charging states': 'Charging States';\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
