List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerConnectionStateManagement' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def VehicleFrame;\n\tpart def HitchBall;\n\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\tpart def Trailer;\n\tpart def TrailerFrame;\n\tconnection def TrailerHitch {\n\t\tend hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\tend coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpart 'vehicle-trailer system' {\t\n\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\t\tpart vehicleFrame : VehicleFrame {\n\t\t\t\tpart hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tconnection trailerHitch : TrailerHitch[0..1]\n\t\t\tconnect vehicle.vehicleFrame.hitch to trailer.trailerFrame.coupler;\n\t\tpart trailer : Trailer {\n\t\t\tpart trailerFrame : TrailerFrame {\n\t\t\t\tpart coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tperform action {\n\t\t\taction 'connect trailer to vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\tabstract ref :>> trailerHitch[1];\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tthen action 'disconnect trailer from vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\tabstract ref :>> trailerHitch[0];\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerConnectionStatus' {\n\tenum def ConnectionState {\n\t\tenum connected;\n\t\tenum disconnected;\n\t}\n\tpart def TowBall;\n\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\tpart def VehicleChassis {\n\t\tpart towBall : TowBall;\n\t}\n\tpart def TrailerFrame {\n\t\tpart coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart chassis : VehicleChassis;\n\t}\npart def Trailer {\n\tpart towStructure : TrailerFrame;\n}\n\tconnection def HitchInterface {\n\t\tend towBall : TowBall[1];\n\t\tend coupler : TrailerCoupler[1];\n\t}\n\taction def HitchTrailer {\n\t\tin towBall : TowBall;\n\t\tin coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\taction def UnhitchTrailer {\n\t\tin towBall : TowBall;\n\t\tin coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpart connectionManager {\n\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tpart trailer : Trailer;\n\t\tconnection hitch : HitchInterface {\n\t\t\tend towBall = vehicle.chassis.towBall;\n\t\t\tend coupler = trailer.towStructure.coupler;\n\t\t}\n\t\tattribute status : ConnectionState = ConnectionState::disconnected;\n\t\taction hitchTrailer : HitchTrailer {\n\t\t\tin towBall = vehicle.chassis.towBall;\n\t\t\tin coupler = trailer.towStructure.coupler;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction unhitchTrailer : UnhitchTrailer {\n\t\t\tin towBall = vehicle.chassis.towBall;\n\t\t\tin coupler = trailer.towStructure.coupler;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
