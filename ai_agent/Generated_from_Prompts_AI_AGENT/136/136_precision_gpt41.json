  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'AutomotiveComponentSpecificationModel' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n    attribute def LengthValue :> Real {\n\t}\n    part def Tire {\n    \tattribute manufacturer: String;\n        attribute hubDiameter: LengthValue;\n        attribute width: Integer;\n    }\n    part frenchTire: Tire {\n    \tattribute :>> manufacturer = \"Michelin\";\n    \tattribute :>> hubDiameter = 18.0;\n    \tattribute :>> width = 245;\n    }\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'TireSpecificationModel' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def Tire {\n\t\tattribute manufacturer : String;\n\t\tattribute rimDiameter : Real;\n\t\tattribute width : Integer;\n\t}\n\tpart michelinTire : Tire {\n\t\tattribute manufacturer = \"Michelin\";\n\t\tattribute rimDiameter = 18.0;\n\t\tattribute width = 245;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
