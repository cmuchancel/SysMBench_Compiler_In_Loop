  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'PhotographyWorkflow' {\n\tpart def Scene;\n\tpart def Image;\n\tpart def Picture;\n\taction def Focus { in item scene : Scene; out item image : Image; }\n\taction def Shoot { in item image : Image; out item picture : Picture; }\n\taction def Display { in item picture : Picture; }\n\taction def TakePicture;\n\taction takePicture : TakePicture {\n\t\tfirst start;\n\t\tthen merge continue;\n\t\tthen action trigger {\n\t\t\tout item scene : Scene;\n\t\t}\n\t\tflow from trigger.scene to focus.scene;\n\t\tthen action focus : Focus {\n\t\t\tin item scene;\n\t\t\tout item image;\n\t\t}\n\t\tflow from focus.image to shoot.image;\n\t\tthen action shoot : Shoot {\n\t\t\tin item image ;\n\t\t\tout item picture;\n\t\t}\n\t\tflow from shoot.picture to display.picture;\n\t\tthen action display : Display {\n\t\t\tin item picture;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen continue;\t\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'CompletePhotographyWorkflow' {\n\tpart def User;\n\tpart def Scene;\n\tpart def Image;\n\tpart def Photograph;\n\tpart def CompletePhotographySystem {\n\t\tpart focusedImage : Image;\n\t\tpart finalPhotograph : Photograph;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Acquire Scene' {\n\t\tsubject system : CompletePhotographySystem;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Focus Scene' {\n\t\tsubject system : CompletePhotographySystem;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Shoot Photograph' {\n\t\tsubject system : CompletePhotographySystem;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Display Photo' {\n\t\tsubject system : CompletePhotographySystem;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'One Tap Take Photo' {\n\t\tsubject system : CompletePhotographySystem;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
