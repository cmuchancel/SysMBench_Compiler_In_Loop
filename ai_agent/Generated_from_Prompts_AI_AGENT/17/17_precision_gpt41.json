  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleFuelSystem' {\n\tattribute def Temp;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelOutPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tport def FuelInPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tin item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tout item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTankAssembly {\n\t\tport fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport engineFuelPort : FuelInPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tflow def FuelFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : Fuel;\n\t\tend port supplierPort : FuelOutPort;\n\t\tend port consumerPort : FuelInPort;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart tankAssy : FuelTankAssembly;\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t\tflow : FuelFlow\n\t\t  from tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelSupply\n\t\t\tto eng.engineFuelPort.fuelSupply;\n\t} \n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleFuelSystemManagement' {\n\tattribute def FuelTemperature;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelTankPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : FuelTemperature;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tport def EnginePort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : FuelTemperature;\n\t\tin item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tout item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTankAssembly {\n\t\tport fuelPort : FuelTankPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport fuelPort : EnginePort;\n\t}\n\tflow def FuelFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : Fuel;\n\t\tend port supplyPort : FuelTankPort;\n\t\tend port receivePort : EnginePort;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelSystem {\n\t\tpart fuelTankAssembly : FuelTankAssembly;\n\t\tpart engine : Engine;\n\t\tflow : FuelFlow\n\t\t  from fuelTankAssembly.fuelPort.fuelSupply\n\t\t\tto engine.fuelPort.fuelSupply;\n\t\tflow : FuelFlow\n\t\t  from engine.fuelPort.fuelReturn\n\t\t\tto fuelTankAssembly.fuelPort.fuelReturn;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
