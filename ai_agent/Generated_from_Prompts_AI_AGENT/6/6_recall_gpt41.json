  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'TrafficLightDefinition' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tenum def TrafficLightColor {\n\t\tenum green;\n\t\tenum yellow;\n\t\tenum red;\n\t}\n\tattribute def ClassificationLevel {\n\t\tattribute code : String;\n\t\tattribute color : TrafficLightColor;\n\t}\n\tenum def ClassificationKind specializes ClassificationLevel {\n\t\tunclassified {\n\t\t\t:>> code = \"uncl\";\n\t\t\t:>> color = TrafficLightColor::green;\n\t\t}\n\t\tconfidential {\n\t\t\t:>> code = \"conf\";\n\t\t\t:>> color = TrafficLightColor::yellow;\n\t\t}\n\t\tsecret {\n\t\t\t:>> code = \"secr\";\n\t\t\t:>> color = TrafficLightColor::red;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tenum def GradePoints :> Real {\n\t\tA = 4.0;\n\t\tB = 3.0;\n\t\tC = 2.0;\n\t\tD = 1.0;\n\t\tF = 0.0;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'InformationClassificationManagement' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def InformationLevel {\n\t\tattribute levelName : String;\n\t\tattribute code : String;\n\t\tattribute color : String;\n\t}\n\tpart def UnclassifiedInformation :> InformationLevel {\n\t\tattribute levelName redefines InformationLevel::levelName = \"Unclassified\";\n\t\tattribute code redefines InformationLevel::code = \"uncl\";\n\t\tattribute color redefines InformationLevel::color = \"Green\";\n\t}\n\tpart def ConfidentialInformation :> InformationLevel {\n\t\tattribute levelName redefines InformationLevel::levelName = \"Confidential\";\n\t\tattribute code redefines InformationLevel::code = \"conf\";\n\t\tattribute color redefines InformationLevel::color = \"Yellow\";\n\t}\n\tpart def SecretInformation :> InformationLevel {\n\t\tattribute levelName redefines InformationLevel::levelName = \"Secret\";\n\t\tattribute code redefines InformationLevel::code = \"secr\";\n\t\tattribute color redefines InformationLevel::color = \"Red\";\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeLevel {\n\t\tattribute grade : String;\n\t\tattribute score : Real;\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeA :> GradeLevel {\n\t\tattribute grade redefines GradeLevel::grade = \"A\";\n\t\tattribute score redefines GradeLevel::score = 4.0;\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeB :> GradeLevel {\n\t\tattribute grade redefines GradeLevel::grade = \"B\";\n\t\tattribute score redefines GradeLevel::score = 3.0;\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeC :> GradeLevel {\n\t\tattribute grade redefines GradeLevel::grade = \"C\";\n\t\tattribute score redefines GradeLevel::score = 2.0;\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeD :> GradeLevel {\n\t\tattribute grade redefines GradeLevel::grade = \"D\";\n\t\tattribute score redefines GradeLevel::score = 1.0;\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeF :> GradeLevel {\n\t\tattribute grade redefines GradeLevel::grade = \"F\";\n\t\tattribute score redefines GradeLevel::score = 0.0;\n\t}\n\tpart def TrafficLightClassificationCatalog {\n\t\tpart unclassified : UnclassifiedInformation;\n\t\tpart confidential : ConfidentialInformation;\n\t\tpart secret : SecretInformation;\n\t}\n\tpart def GradeClassificationCatalog {\n\t\tpart gradeA : GradeA;\n\t\tpart gradeB : GradeB;\n\t\tpart gradeC : GradeC;\n\t\tpart gradeD : GradeD;\n\t\tpart gradeF : GradeF;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
