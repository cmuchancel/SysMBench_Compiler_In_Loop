List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'PhotographyWorkflow' {\n\titem def Scene;\n\titem def Image;\n\titem def Picture;\n\taction def Focus { in scene : Scene; out image : Image; }\n\taction def Shoot { in image: Image; out picture : Picture; }\t\n\taction def TakePicture {\n\t\tin item scene : Scene;\n\t\tout item picture : Picture;\n\t\tbind focus.scene = scene;\n\t\taction focus: Focus { in scene; out image; }\n\t\tflow from focus.image to shoot.image;\n\t\tfirst focus then shoot;\n\t\taction shoot: Shoot { in image; out picture; }\n\t\tbind shoot.picture = picture;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'SceneFramingCapture' {\n\titem def Scene;\n\titem def FocusedImage;\n\titem def Photograph;\n\tport def ScenePort {\n\t\tout item scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tport def FocusingPort {\n\t\tin item selectedScene : Scene;\n\t\tout item generatedImage : FocusedImage;\n\t}\n\tport def ShootingPort {\n\t\tin item preparedImage : FocusedImage;\n\t\tout item finalPhotograph : Photograph;\n\t}\n\tport def PhotoOutputPort {\n\t\tin item deliveredPhoto : Photograph;\n\t}\n\tpart def SceneSelection {\n\t\tport sceneOutput : ScenePort;\n\t}\n\tpart def FocusingProcess {\n\t\tport focus : FocusingPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def ShootingProcess {\n\t\tport shoot : ShootingPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def PhotoDelivery {\n\t\tport output : PhotoOutputPort;\n\t}\n\tflow def SceneFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : Scene;\n\t\tend port selector : ScenePort;\n\t\tend port focusing : FocusingPort;\n\t}\n\tflow def FocusedImageFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : FocusedImage;\n\t\tend port focusing : FocusingPort;\n\t\tend port shooting : ShootingPort;\n\t}\n\tflow def PhotoFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : Photograph;\n\t\tend port shooting : ShootingPort;\n\t\tend port delivery : PhotoOutputPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def PhotographyWorkflow {\n\t\tpart selection : SceneSelection;\n\t\tpart focusing : FocusingProcess;\n\t\tpart shooting : ShootingProcess;\n\t\tpart delivery : PhotoDelivery;\n\t\tflow : SceneFlow\n\t\t  from selection.sceneOutput.scene\n\t\t\tto focusing.focus.selectedScene;\n\t\tflow : FocusedImageFlow\n\t\t  from focusing.focus.generatedImage\n\t\t\tto shooting.shoot.preparedImage;\n\t\tflow : PhotoFlow\n\t\t  from shooting.shoot.finalPhotograph\n\t\t\tto delivery.output.deliveredPhoto;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.\n\n#### **1. Package**\n- **Not supported**: The package name is different, but that's to be ignored. The reference model is about a photography workflow, so this is semantically supported.\n\n#### **2. Item `Scene`**\n- **Supported**: Exists in the reference model.\n\n#### **3. Item `FocusedImage`**\n- **Not supported**: The reference model has `Image`, but not `FocusedImage`. In the reference model, the output of `Focus` is `Image`, which is then input to `Shoot`. So, `FocusedImage` is a renamed `Image`. **Supported** (naming difference is ignored).\n\n#### **4. Item `Photograph`**\n- **Not supported**: The reference model uses `Picture` as the final output. `Photograph` is a synonym for `Picture`. **Supported** (naming difference is ignored).\n\n#### **5. Port `ScenePort` with output `scene: Scene`**\n- **Not supported**: The reference model does not define ports, but the concept of providing a `Scene` is present as input to `Focus`. **Supported** (structural difference, but semantically equivalent).\n\n#### **6. Port `FocusingPort` with input `selectedScene: Scene` and output `generatedImage: FocusedImage`**\n- **Not supported**: No ports in reference, but the action `Focus` takes `scene: Scene` and outputs `image: Image`. **Supported** (structural difference, but semantically equivalent).\n\n#### **7. Port `ShootingPort` with input `preparedImage: FocusedImage` and output `finalPhotograph: Photograph`**\n- **Not supported**: No ports in reference, but the action `Shoot` takes `image: Image` and outputs `picture: Picture`. **Supported** (structural difference, but semantically equivalent).\n\n#### **8. Port `PhotoOutputPort` with input `deliveredPhoto: Photograph`**\n- **Not supported**: No ports in reference, but the final output is `picture: Picture`. **Supported** (structural difference, but semantically equivalent).\n\n#### **9. Part `SceneSelection` with port `sceneOutput: ScenePort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit part for scene selection in the reference model, but the process starts with a `Scene`. **Supported** (structural difference, but semantically equivalent).\n\n#### **10. Part `FocusingProcess` with port `focus: FocusingPort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit part, but the `Focus` action exists. **Supported**.\n\n#### **11. Part `ShootingProcess` with port `shoot: ShootingPort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit part, but the `Shoot` action exists. **Supported**.\n\n#### **12. Part `PhotoDelivery` with port `output: PhotoOutputPort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit part, but the output of the workflow is a `Picture`. **Supported**.\n\n#### **13. Flow `SceneFlow` carrying `Scene` between `ScenePort` and `FocusingPort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit flow, but the data flow from `scene` to `Focus` is present. **Supported**.\n\n#### **14. Flow `FocusedImageFlow` carrying `FocusedImage` between `FocusingPort` and `ShootingPort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit flow, but the data flow from `Focus` to `Shoot` is present. **Supported**.\n\n#### **15. Flow `PhotoFlow` carrying `Photograph` between `ShootingPort` and `PhotoOutputPort`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit flow, but the data flow from `Shoot` to output is present. **Supported**.\n\n#### **16. Part `PhotographyWorkflow` containing:**\n- **Supported**: The reference model defines a composite action `TakePicture` that orchestrates the process.\n\n##### **17. Part `selection: SceneSelection`**\n- **Not supported**: Not explicit, but the process starts with a `Scene`. **Supported**.\n\n##### **18. Part `focusing: FocusingProcess`**\n- **Not supported**: Not explicit, but the `Focus` action exists. **Supported**.\n\n##### **19. Part `shooting: ShootingProcess`**\n- **Not supported**: Not explicit, but the `Shoot` action exists. **Supported**.\n\n##### **20. Part `delivery: PhotoDelivery`**\n- **Not supported**: Not explicit, but the output is delivered. **Supported**.\n\n##### **21. Flow `SceneFlow` from `selection.sceneOutput.scene` to `focusing.focus.selectedScene`**\n- **Not supported**: No explicit flow, but the data flow is present. **Supported**.\n\n##### **22.
