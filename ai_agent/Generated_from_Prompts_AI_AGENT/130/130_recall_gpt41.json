List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleSafetyandSecurityComplianceCatalog' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tprivate import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\tprivate import PartsTree::*;\n\tpackage AnnotationDefinitions {\n\t\tmetadata def Safety {\n\t\t\tattribute isMandatory : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetadata def Security;\n\t}\n\tpackage PartsTree {\n\t\tpart vehicle {\n\t\t\tpart interior {\n\t\t\t\tpart alarm {@Security;}\n\t\t\t\tpart seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\t\tpart frontSeat[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart driverAirBag {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart bodyAssy {\n\t\t\t\tpart body;\n\t\t\t\tpart bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\t\tpart keylessEntry {@Security;}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart wheelAssy {\n\t\t\t\tpart wheel[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart antilockBrakes[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Safety Features' {\t\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**[@Safety];\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Security Features' {\t\t\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**[@Security];\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Safety & Security Features' {\t\t \n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**[@Safety or @Security];\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Mandatory Saftey Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**[@Safety and Safety::isMandatory];\n\t}\n}\n\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleSafetySecurityCompliance' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpackage AnnotationDefinitions {\n\t\tmetadata def Safety {\n\t\t\tattribute isMandatory : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetadata def Security {\n\t\t\tattribute isRequired : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tprivate import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart interior {\n\t\t\tpart seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\tpart airBag {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\tpart alarm {@Security{isRequired = true;}}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart body {\n\t\t\tpart bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\tpart keylessEntry {@Security{isRequired = true;}}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart chassis {\n\t\t\tpart wheel[2];\n\t\t\tpart antiLockBrakingSystem[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle;\n\tpackage 'Safety Components' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Safety;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Mandatory Safety Components' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Safety and Safety::isMandatory;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Optional Safety Components' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Safety and not Safety::isMandatory;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Security Components' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Security;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Required Security Components' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Security and Security::isRequired;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
