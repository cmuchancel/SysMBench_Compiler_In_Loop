List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'WaterDelivery' {\n\tport def SpigotBank;\n\tport def Spigot;\n\tport def Faucet;\n\tport def FaucetInlet;\n\tinterface def WaterDelivery {\n\t\tend suppliedBy : SpigotBank[1] {\n\t\t\tport hot : Spigot;\n\t\t\tport cold : Spigot;\n\t\t}\n\t\tend deliveredTo : Faucet[1..*] {\n\t\t\tport hot : FaucetInlet;\n\t\t\tport cold : FaucetInlet;\n\t\t}\n\t\tconnect suppliedBy.hot to deliveredTo.hot;\n\t\tconnect suppliedBy.cold to deliveredTo.cold;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'HotColdWaterSupplyNetwork' {\n\tattribute def WaterTemperature;\n\tpart def Water;\n\tport def Spigot {\n\t\tattribute temperature : WaterTemperature;\n\t\tout item hotWater : Water;\n\t\tout item coldWater : Water;\n\t}\n\tport def FaucetInlet {\n\t\tin item hotWater : Water;\n\t\tin item coldWater : Water;\n\t}\n\tpart def SpigotBank {\n\t\tport spigot[*] : Spigot;\n\t}\n\tpart def Faucet {\n\t\tport inlet : FaucetInlet;\n\t}\n\tflow def HotWaterFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : Water;\n\t\tend port supplier : Spigot;\n\t\tend port consumer : FaucetInlet;\n\t}\n\tflow def ColdWaterFlow {\n\t\tref :>> payload : Water;\n\t\tend port supplier : Spigot;\n\t\tend port consumer : FaucetInlet;\n\t}\n\tpart def WaterSupplyNetwork {\n\t\tpart spigotBank : SpigotBank;\n\t\tpart faucet[*] : Faucet;\n\t\tflow : HotWaterFlow\n\t\t  from spigotBank.spigot.hotWater\n\t\t\tto faucet.inlet.hotWater;\n\t\tflow : ColdWaterFlow\n\t\t  from spigotBank.spigot.coldWater\n\t\t\tto faucet.inlet.coldWater;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
