List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassVerificationTestSystem' {\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute mass :> ISQ::mass;\n\t}\n\trequirement vehicleMassRequirement {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tin massActual :> ISQ::mass = vehicle.mass;\n\t\tdoc /* The vehicle mass shall be less than or equal to 2500 kg. */\n\t\trequire constraint { massActual <= 2500[SI::kg] }\n\t}\t\n\tverification def VehicleMassTest {\n\t\tprivate import VerificationCases::*;\n\t\tsubject testVehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tobjective vehicleMassVerificationObjective {\n\t\t\t// The subject of the verify is automatically bound to 'testVehicle' here.\n\t\t\tverify vehicleMassRequirement;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction collectData {\n\t\t\tin part testVehicle : Vehicle = VehicleMassTest::testVehicle;\n\t\t\tout massMeasured :> ISQ::mass;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction processData {\n\t\t\tin massMeasured :> ISQ::mass = collectData.massMeasured;\n\t\t\tout massProcessed :> ISQ::mass;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction evaluateData {\n\t\t\tin massProcessed :> ISQ::mass = processData.massProcessed;\n\t\t\tout verdict : VerdictKind = \n\t\t\t\t// Check that 'testVehicle' statisfies 'vehicleMassRequirement' if its mass equals 'massProcessed'.\n\t\t\t\tPassIf(vehicleMassRequirement(vehicle = testVehicle(mass = massProcessed)));\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn verdict : VerdictKind = evaluateData.verdict;\n\t}\n\tpart def MassVerificationSystem;\n\tpart def Scale;\n\tpart vehicleTestConfig : Vehicle {\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\tverification vehicleMassTest : VehicleMassTest {\n\t\tsubject testVehicle :> vehicleTestConfig;\n\t}\n\tpart massVerificationSystem : MassVerificationSystem {\n\t\tperform vehicleMassTest;\t\n\t\tpart scale : Scale {\n\t\t\tperform vehicleMassTest.collectData {\n\t\t\t\tin part :>> testVehicle;\n\t\t\t\t// In reality, this would be some more involved process.\n\t\t\t\tmeasurement = testVehicle.mass;\n\t\t\t\tout :>> massMeasured = measurement;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\t\t\n\tindividual def TestSystem :> MassVerificationSystem;\n\tindividual def TestVehicle1 :> Vehicle;\n\tindividual def TestVehicle2 :> Vehicle;\n\tindividual testSystem : TestSystem :> massVerificationSystem {\n\t\ttimeslice test1 {\n\t\t\tperform action :>> vehicleMassTest {\n\t\t\t\tin individual :>> testVehicle : TestVehicle1 {\n\t\t\t\t\t:>> mass = 2500[SI::kg];\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen timeslice test2 {\n\t\t\tperform action :>> vehicleMassTest {\n\t\t\t\tin individual :>> testVehicle : TestVehicle2 {\n\t\t\t\t\t:>> mass = 3000[SI::kg];\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassVerification076' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\t\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute measuredMass : Real;\n\t}\n\t\n\trequirement def VehicleMassRequirement {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tattribute maxMass : Real = 2500.0;\n\t\trequire constraint { vehicle.measuredMass <= maxMass }\n\t}\n\t\n\tverification def VehicleMassInspection {\n\t\tsubject inspectedVehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\trequirement vehicleMassRequirement : VehicleMassRequirement {\n\t\t\tsubject vehicle = inspectedVehicle;\n\t\t}\n\t\tobjective verifyVehicleMass {\n\t\t\tverify vehicleMassRequirement;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart weighingEquipment {\n\t\t\taction measureMass {\n\t\t\t\tout measuredMass : Real;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\taction processMeasurement {\n\t\t\tin measuredMass : Real = weighingEquipment.measureMass.measuredMass;\n\t\t\tout processedMass : Real = measuredMass;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction evaluateMeasurement {\n\t\t\tin processedMass : Real = processMeasurement.processedMass;\n\t\t\tout verdict : Boolean = processedMass <= VehicleMassRequirement::maxMass;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn verificationVerdict : Boolean = evaluateMeasurement.verdict;\n\t}\n\t\n\tpart vehicleInspectionContext {\n\t\tpart vehicleUnderTest : Vehicle;\n\t\trequirement vehicleMassRequirement : VehicleMassRequirement {\n\t\t\tsubject vehicle = vehicleInspectionContext.vehicleUnderTest;\n\t\t}\n\t\tverification inspection : VehicleMassInspection {\n\t\t\tsubject inspectedVehicle = vehicleInspectionContext.vehicleUnderTest;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
