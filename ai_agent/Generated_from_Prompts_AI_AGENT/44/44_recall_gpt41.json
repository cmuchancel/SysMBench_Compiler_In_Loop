List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'CruiseControlEventFlow' {\t\n\tpart def Driver;\n\tpart def CruiseController;\n\tpart def Speedometer;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart driver : Driver {\n\t\tevent occurrence setSpeedSent;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart cruiseController : CruiseController {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence setSpeedReceived;\t\t\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence sensedSpeedReceived;\t\t\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence fuelCommandSent;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart speedometer : Speedometer {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence sensedSpeedSent;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart engine : Engine {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence fuelCommandReceived;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'CruiseControlSystem' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::Real;\n\t\n\titem def SetSpeedCommand {\n\t\tattribute targetSpeed : Real;\n\t}\n\t\n\titem def SpeedMeasurement {\n\t\tattribute actualSpeed : Real;\n\t}\n\t\n\titem def FuelControlCommand {\n\t\tattribute throttleSetting : Real;\n\t}\n\t\n\tport def SetSpeedSource {\n\t\tout item command : SetSpeedCommand;\n\t}\n\t\n\tport def SetSpeedSink {\n\t\tin item command : SetSpeedCommand;\n\t}\n\t\n\tport def SpeedMeasurementSource {\n\t\tout item measurement : SpeedMeasurement;\n\t}\n\t\n\tport def SpeedMeasurementSink {\n\t\tin item measurement : SpeedMeasurement;\n\t}\n\t\n\tport def FuelControlSource {\n\t\tout item command : FuelControlCommand;\n\t}\n\t\n\tport def FuelControlSink {\n\t\tin item command : FuelControlCommand;\n\t}\n\t\n\tpart driver {\n\t\tport setSpeedPort : SetSpeedSource;\n\t}\n\t\npart vehicle {\n\t\tpart cruiseController {\n\t\t\tport setSpeedPort : SetSpeedSink;\n\t\t\tport speedPort : SpeedMeasurementSink;\n\t\t\tport fuelCommandPort : FuelControlSource;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart speedometer {\n\t\t\tport speedPort : SpeedMeasurementSource;\n\t\t\tattribute sensedSpeed : Real;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart engine {\n\t\t\tport fuelCommandPort : FuelControlSink;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\nconnect driver.setSpeedPort to vehicle.cruiseController.setSpeedPort;\nconnect vehicle.speedometer.speedPort to vehicle.cruiseController.speedPort;\nconnect vehicle.cruiseController.fuelCommandPort to vehicle.engine.fuelCommandPort;\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
