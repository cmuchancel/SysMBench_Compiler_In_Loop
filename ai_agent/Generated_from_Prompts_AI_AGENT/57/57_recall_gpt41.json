List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. The model is in a package called `MassRollup`.\n- **Generated model:** Package is called `MassThresholdAggregation`.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (package presence, name difference ignored).\n\n#### 2. The model imports `NumericalFunctions::*` privately.\n- **Generated model:** Imports `ScalarValues::*` privately.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (import of numerical/utility functions, name difference ignored).\n\n#### 3. There is a part definition `MassedThing`.\n- **Generated model:** Part definition `Component`.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (equivalent part definition).\n\n#### 4. `MassedThing` has an attribute `simpleMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n- **Generated model:** `Component` has attribute `basicMass : Real`.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (attribute for mass, type difference is superficial).\n\n#### 5. `MassedThing` has an attribute `totalMass` of type `ISQ::mass`, with a default value of `simpleMass`.\n- **Generated model:** `Component` has attribute `totalMass : Real`, but no default value specified at the definition level.\n- **Coverage:** **Partial/No** (attribute exists, but default value is not specified at the definition level).\n\n#### 6. There is a part `compositeThing` of type `MassedThing`.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit part named `compositeThing`, but `componentRoot` is a `Component` and serves as a composite.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (structural equivalent exists).\n\n#### 7. `compositeThing` has a part `subcomponents` which is a collection (`[*]`) of `MassedThing`.\n- **Generated model:** `Component` has `subcomponents : Component[*]`.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes**.\n\n#### 8. `compositeThing` has an attribute `totalMass` whose value is defined as `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`.\n- **Generated model:** In `componentRoot`, `totalMass` is redefined as `basicMass + subcomponents.heavyComponent.basicMass + subcomponents.majorSubassembly.basicMass`.\n- **Coverage:** **Partial/Yes** (the idea of total mass as sum of own mass and subcomponents is present, but the formula is hardcoded for the instance, not generic).\n\n#### 9.
