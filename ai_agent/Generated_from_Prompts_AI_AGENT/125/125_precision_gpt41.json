List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\nprivate import Views::*; \npackage 'VehicleSafetyandSecurityFeatureManagement' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpackage AnnotationDefinitions {\t\n\t\tmetadata def Safety {\n\t\t\tattribute isMandatory : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetadata def Security;\n\t}\n\tpackage PartsTree {\n\t\tpublic import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\t\tpart vehicle {\n\t\t\tpart interior {\n\t\t\t\tpart alarm {@Security;}\n\t\t\t\tpart seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\t\tpart frontSeat[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart driverAirBag {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart bodyAssy {\n\t\t\t\tpart body;\n\t\t\t\tpart bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\t\tpart keylessEntry {@Security;}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart wheelAssy {\n\t\t\t\tpart wheel[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart antilockBrakes[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpackage ViewDefinitions {\t\n\t\tpublic import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\t\tview def SafetyFeatureView {\n\t\t\t/* Parts that contribute to safety. */\t\t\n\t\t\tfilter @Safety;\n\t\t\trender asTreeDiagram;\n\t\t}\n\t\tview def SafetyOrSecurityFeatureView {\n\t\t\t/* Parts that contribute to safety OR security. */\t\t \n\t\t\tfilter @Safety | @Security;\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\n\tpackage Views {\n\t\tprivate import ViewDefinitions::*;\n\t\tprivate import PartsTree::vehicle;\n\t\tview vehicleSafetyFeatureView : SafetyFeatureView {\n\t\t\texpose vehicle::**;\n\t\t}\n\t\tview vehicleMandatorySafetyFeatureView :> vehicleSafetyFeatureView {\n\t\t\tfilter Safety::isMandatory;\n\t\t}\n\t\tview vehicleMandatorySafetyFeatureViewStandalone {\n\t\t\texpose vehicle::**[@Safety and Safety::isMandatory];\n\t\t\trender asElementTable;\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleSafetySecurityView' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tprivate import Views::*;\n\tpackage AnnotationDefinitions {\n\t\tmetadata def Safety {\n\t\t\tattribute isMandatory : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetadata def Security;\n\t}\n\tprivate import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart interior {\n\t\t\tpart seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\tpart airBag {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\tpart alarm {@Security;}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart body {\n\t\t\tpart bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\tpart keylessEntry {@Security;}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart chassis {\n\t\t\tpart antiLockBrakingSystem {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle;\n\tpackage 'Safety Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Safety;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Mandatory Safety Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Safety and Safety::isMandatory;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Optional Safety Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Safety and not Safety::isMandatory;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Security Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle::**;\n\t\tfilter @Security;\n\t}\n\tview 'Safety Feature Tree' {\n\t\texpose 'Safety Features'::*;\n\t\trender asTreeDiagram;\n\t}\n\tview 'Safety Feature Table' {\n\t\texpose 'Safety Features'::*;\n\t\trender asElementTable {\n\t\t\tview redefines columnView[1] {\n\t\t\t\tref rendering = Views::asTextualNotation;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tview 'Security Feature Table' {\n\t\texpose 'Security Features'::*;\n\t\trender asElementTable {\n\t\t\tview redefines columnView[1] {\n\t\t\t\tref rendering = Views::asTextualNotation;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
