List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerCouplingSystemModeling' {\n\tpackage Definitions {\n\t\tpart def Vehicle;\n\t\tpart def Trailer;\n\t\tpart def TrailerHitch;\n\t\tpart def HitchBall;\n\t\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpackage Usages {\n\t\tprivate import Definitions::*;\n\t\tpart vehicle_trailer_system {\n\t\t\tpart vehicle1_c1: Vehicle {\n\t\t\t\tref hitchBall : HitchBall {\n\t\t\t\t\t/*\n\t\t\t\t\t * 'vehicle1_c1'::'hitchBall' is a reference property that\n\t\t\t\t\t * references a hitch ball that is not part of this vehicle. \n\t\t\t\t\t * If 'vehicle1_c1' is removed or destroyed, this does not\n\t\t\t\t\t * effect the hitchBall referenced here.\n\t\t\t\t\t */\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tbind vehicle1_c1.hitchBall = trailerHitch.hitchBall {\n\t\t\t\t/*\n\t\t\t\t * This is a binding connector between the 'hitchBall' in 'vehicle1_c1'\n\t\t\t\t * and the 'hitchBall' in 'trailerHitch'.\n\t\t\t\t */\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart trailerHitch: TrailerHitch {\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tpart hitchBall: HitchBall;\n\t\t\t\tpart trailerCoupler: TrailerCoupler;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart trailer1: Trailer {\n\t\t\t\tref trailerCoupler : TrailerCoupler = trailerHitch.trailerCoupler {\n\t\t\t\t\t/*\n\t\t\t\t\t * This is a shorthand for a binding connector between the\n\t\t\t\t\t * 'trailerCoupler' here and the 'trailerCoupler' in 'trailerHitch'.\n\t\t\t\t\t * The binding connector is now contained within the 'trailer1'\n\t\t\t\t\t * part, though, rather than being at the system level. \n\t\t\t\t\t */\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerCoupling' {\n\tpart def CouplingBall;\n\tpart def HitchConnector;\n\tpart def Hitch {\n\t\tpart ball : CouplingBall;\n\t\tpart connector : HitchConnector;\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tref part couplingBall : CouplingBall;\n\t}\n\tpart def Trailer {\n\t\tref part hitchConnector : HitchConnector;\n\t}\n\tconnection def CouplingInterface {\n\t\tend vehicle : Vehicle[1];\n\t\tend trailer : Trailer[1];\n\t\tend hitch : Hitch[1];\n\t}\n\tpart couplingAssembly {\n\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tpart trailer : Trailer;\n\t\tpart hitch : Hitch;\n\t\tconnection couplingLink : CouplingInterface {\n\t\t\tend vehicle = couplingAssembly::vehicle;\n\t\t\tend trailer = couplingAssembly::trailer;\n\t\t\tend hitch = couplingAssembly::hitch;\n\t\t}\n\t\tbind vehicle.couplingBall = hitch.ball;\n\t\tbind trailer.hitchConnector = hitch.connector;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
