List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage Camera {\n\tprivate import 'Action Decomposition'::*;\n\tpart def Scene;\n\tpart def Image;\n\tpart def Picture;\n\tpart def Camera;\n\tpart def FocusingSubsystem;\n\tpart def ImagingSubsystem;\n\tpart camera : Camera {\n\t\tref item scene : Scene;\n\t\tpart photos : Picture[*];\n\t\tpart autoFocus {\n\t\t\tin ref item scene : Scene = camera::scene;\t\t\n\t\t\tout ref item realImage : Image;\n\t\t}\n\t\tflow autoFocus.realImage to imager.focusedImage;\n\t\tpart imager {\n\t\t\tin item focusedImage : Image;\t\t\n\t\t\tout item photo : Picture :> photos;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'CameraSceneCaptureSystem' {\n\tpart def User;\n\tpart def Scene;\n\tpart def AutofocusSubsystem;\n\tpart def ImagingSubsystem;\n\tpart def PhotoArchive;\n\tpart def Camera {\n\t\tpart autofocusSubsystem : AutofocusSubsystem;\n\t\tpart imagingSubsystem : ImagingSubsystem;\n\t\tpart photoArchive : PhotoArchive;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Select Scene' {\n\t\tsubject camera : Camera;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Autofocus Scene' {\n\t\tsubject autofocusSubsystem : AutofocusSubsystem;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Capture Photograph' {\n\t\tsubject imagingSubsystem : ImagingSubsystem;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Record Photograph' {\n\t\tsubject camera : Camera;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Automated Scene Photography' {\n\t\tsubject camera : Camera;\n\t\tactor user : User;\n\t\tactor scene : Scene;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
