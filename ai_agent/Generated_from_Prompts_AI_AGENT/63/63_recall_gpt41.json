List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassBudgetingConstraints' {\n\tprivate import ISQ::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n\tprivate import NumericalFunctions::*;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def Transmission;\n\tconstraint def MassConstraint {\n\t\tin partMasses : MassValue[0..*];\n\t\tin massLimit : MassValue;\n\t}\n\tconstraint massConstraint : MassConstraint {\n\t\tin partMasses : MassValue[0..*];\n\t\tin massLimit : MassValue;\t\t\n\t\tsum(partMasses) <= massLimit\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tassert massConstraint {\n\t\t\tin partMasses = (chassisMass, engine.mass, transmission.mass);\n\t\t\tin massLimit = 2500[kg];\n\t\t}\t\n\t\tattribute chassisMass : MassValue;\n\t\tpart engine : Engine {\n\t\t\tattribute mass : MassValue;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart transmission : Engine {\n\t\t\tattribute mass : MassValue;\n\t\t}\n\t}\t\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassConstraint063' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\t\n\tattribute MaxVehicleMass : Real = 2500.0;\n\t\n\tpart vehicle {\n\t\tattribute chassisMassKilograms : Real;\n\t\tattribute engineMassKilograms : Real;\n\t\tattribute transmissionMassKilograms : Real;\n\t\tattribute totalMassKilograms : Real = chassisMassKilograms + engineMassKilograms + transmissionMassKilograms;\n\t\tattribute meetsMassRequirement : Boolean = totalMassKilograms <= MaxVehicleMass;\n\t\tconstraint massRequirement {\n\t\t\tconstraint { totalMassKilograms <= MaxVehicleMass }\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
