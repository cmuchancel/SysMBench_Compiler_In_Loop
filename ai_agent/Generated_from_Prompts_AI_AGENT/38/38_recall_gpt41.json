  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehiclePowerManagement' {\n\tattribute def VehicleStartSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleOnSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleOffSignal;\n\tstate def VehicleStates;\n\tstate vehicleStates : VehicleStates {\n\t\tentry; then off;\n\t\tstate off;\n\t\taccept VehicleStartSignal \n\t\t\tthen starting;\n\t\tstate starting;\n\t\taccept VehicleOnSignal\n\t\t\tthen on;\n\t\tstate on;\n\t\taccept VehicleOffSignal\n\t\t\tthen off;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'VehicleStateControl' {\n\tattribute def VehicleStartSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleStartedSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleShutdownSignal;\n\t\n\tstate def VehicleStateMachine;\n\t\n\tpart vehicleController {\n\t\tstate vehicleState : VehicleStateMachine {\n\t\t\tentry action initial;\n\t\t\ttransition initial then shutdown;\n\t\t\tstate shutdown;\n\t\t\ttransition 'shutdown-startup'\n\t\t\t\tfirst shutdown\n\t\t\t\taccept VehicleStartSignal\n\t\t\t\tthen startup;\n\t\t\tstate startup;\n\t\t\ttransition 'startup-running'\n\t\t\t\tfirst startup\n\t\t\t\taccept VehicleStartedSignal\n\t\t\t\tthen running;\n\t\t\tstate running;\n\t\t\ttransition 'running-shutdown'\n\t\t\t\tfirst running\n\t\t\t\taccept VehicleShutdownSignal\n\t\t\t\tthen shutdown;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
