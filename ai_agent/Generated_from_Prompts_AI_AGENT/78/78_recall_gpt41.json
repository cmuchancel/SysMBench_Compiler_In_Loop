List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'CompleteTransportationScenario' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def Person;\n\tpart def Environment;\n\tpart def 'Fuel Station';\n\tuse case def 'Provide Transportation' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t\tactor environment : Environment;\n\t\tobjective {\n\t\t\tdoc \n\t\t\t/* Transport driver and passengers from starting location \n\t\t\t * to ending location.\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t}\t\t\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Enter Vehicle' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Exit Vehicle' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t}\n\tpart def 'Fuel Station';\n\tuse case 'provide transportation' : 'Provide Transportation' {\t\t\n\t\tfirst start;\n\t\tthen include use case 'enter vehicle' : 'Enter Vehicle' {\n\t\t\tactor :>> driver = 'provide transportation'::driver;\n\t\t\tactor :>> passengers = 'provide transportation'::passengers;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen use case 'drive vehicle' {\n\t\t\tactor driver = 'provide transportation'::driver;\n\t\t\tactor environment = 'provide transportation'::environment;\t\n\t\t\tinclude 'add fuel'[0..*] { \n\t\t\t\tactor :>> fueler = driver;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen include use case 'exit vehicle' : 'Exit Vehicle' {\n\t\t\tactor :>> driver = 'provide transportation'::driver;\n\t\t\tactor :>> passengers = 'provide transportation'::passengers;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen done;\t\t\n\t}\n\tuse case 'add fuel' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor fueler : Person;\n\t\tactor 'fuel station' : 'Fuel Station';\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage 'TransportationUseCase078' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def Person;\n\t\n\tuse case def 'Provide Transportation' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t}\n}\n\n\nOutput:",
