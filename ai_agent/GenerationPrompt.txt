You are in /Users/chancelavoie/Desktop/sysml_context_package. Before any command or tool invocation, run source .venv/bin/activate. Mission Generate SysML v2 models that precisely reflect the NL prompts you are given. Use the curated grammar references in sysml_context_package/context_examples/ (47/47 grammar types) to guide syntax and patterns. Coverage must be complete (every NL fact modeled) while keeping models as minimal as possible. Context to load before each batch Read every pair in sysml_context_package/context_examples/: each subdir has nl.txt + design.sysml. Internalize the grammar patterns across all 47 types. Specification: sysml_context_package/formal-25-09-05.pdf for syntax/semantics only. Generation inputs: NL-only prompts live in sysml_context_package/generation_prompts/ (folders NNN/ with nl.txt only). These are the prompts you must model. Calibration (how to apply references) Keep nl.txt and design.sysml together when learning patterns; never separate them. Infer grammar usage from the references and be ready to apply any grammar type to the target NL prompt. Structural emphasis: Part, Connection, Binding_Connector, Package, Port, Interface, Subsetting, Redefinition. Behavioral emphasis: Action, Action_Definition, Opaque_Action, State, Transition, State-based_Behavior, SequenceModeling, Conditional_Succession, Control_Structure. Parametric/analytical emphasis: Calculation, Constraint, Analysis, Analysis_and_Trade, Expression, Flow_Connection. Default: use the full reference set for maximum fidelity; mix styles only when NL clearly demands it. Minimality Rules Model only what the NL states; no extra hierarchy, behavior, multiplicity, types, or abstractions beyond what references justify. Use primitive types (Integer, Real, Boolean, String) unless NL provides a concrete type/units. Do not invent units/datatypes. Match NL wording for names (capitalization, plurality). Use part for contained elements; ref part only if NL implies external assignment. Multiplicity only when NL states quantity/range. Never add [1], 1..1, or defaults—omit multiplicity for singular elements. Keep structure flat; no wrapper packages or invented constructs. No comments in generated .sysml. Per-Prompt Workflow (for every generation_prompts/**/nl.txt; preserve subdirectories, e.g., …/1/nl.txt → …/1.sysml) Record ISO 8601 start timestamp before reading NL. Read NL verbatim; privately list every explicit fact (components, interfaces, attributes, quantities, states, requirements, risks, actors, counts, etc.). Select matching grammar patterns from the loaded context and author a single package named to reflect the NL. Two-way coverage audit: a. NL → Model: every listed fact appears exactly once; add missing items with simplest allowed construct. b. Model → NL: every model element is justified by explicit NL; remove anything unsupported. Iterate until both directions align. Run python -m syside check <relative/path/to/sysml> until it passes. Git: git add <relative/path>; git commit -m "Add SysML model for <prompt_basename>". Record end timestamp, compute whole-second duration, append prompt_id,start_time,end_time,duration_seconds to timings.csv. Move to next prompt; never reuse prior model content. Reporting Process <PROMPT RANGE>. When all models validate and are committed, report handled prompt IDs and their .sysml paths.
