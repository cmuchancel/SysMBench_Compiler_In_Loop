%%  Class options include:
%%
%%          * An option to use the traditional grid arrangement of author names, [grid].  
%%			*	 With this option, line breaks (\\) may be inserted into the address as needed. 
%%			*	 Author names that include commas should be enclosed in braces, e.g.,  {Joseph L. Smith, Jr.}.  
%%			*	 Authors may be grouped above a single affiliation using braces, e.g., {Henry Tudor, Catherine Parr}.
%%
%%          * An option to balance the heights of columns on the last page, [balance].

\section{Introduction}
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) replaces document-centric workflows with model-centric engineering, where formal artifacts carry requirements, structure, behavior, and verification intent across the lifecycle~\cite{estefan2007mbseSurvey,madni2018mbse,incoseMbseInitiative2025,sebokMBSE2025}. By making the model the primary technical source, MBSE reduces cross-document reconciliation overhead and improves traceability under change~\cite{madni2018mbse,incoseSEVision2035}.

SysMLv2 strengthens this transition by standardizing a formal language with complementary textual and graphical representations and machine-readable artifacts under OMG~\cite{omgSysMLv2Spec2024,omgSysMLv2About2025,omgSysMLv2FinalAdoption2025}. In practice, the same model can be authored as text, rendered visually, and exchanged across tools with less ambiguity. Because SysMLv2 is formal and textual, model construction is scriptable.

This scriptability, combined with the recent rise of LLMs in engineering practice, creates a concrete opportunity for automated SysMLv2 modeling workflows. LLM-based pipelines can generate candidate models directly from natural-language inputs.

Software engineering provides encouraging precedent: controlled and field studies report substantial productivity gains from LLM-assisted generation, including 55.8\% faster task completion, 26.08\% higher weekly completed tasks in enterprise randomized deployments, and measurable increases in pull-request throughput~\cite{peng2023copilot,cui2025highSkilled,demirer2024fieldCopilot}. These results suggest that integrating generation into everyday tool use can materially accelerate engineering iteration.

The analogous opportunity in MBSE is to automate low-value model authoring steps while increasing modeling velocity. If natural-language prompts can be converted into \emph{production-validator--accepted} SysMLv2, teams can spend less effort on syntax correction and more effort on architecture and verification reasoning.

Motivated by this potential, recent SysMLv2 generation systems have moved beyond unreliable one-shot prompting toward structured generation workflows~\cite{bouamra2025systemp,cibrian2025sysmlagent}. SysTemp uses a template-first multi-agent design centered on a \textit{TemplateGeneratorAgent} and a \textit{ParserAgent}. A Jinja2-based template tool first builds a structured SysMLv2 skeleton, then a writer agent fills in content while parser feedback guides iterative correction~\cite{bouamra2025systemp}. By contrast, the 2025 \emph{Computers in Industry} framework organizes generation as an agentic loop with a RAG-based context engine and a validation engine, with ANTLR-based grammar validation as the syntax gate~\cite{cibrian2025sysmlagent}. In that framework, the context engine retrieves semantically similar natural-language prompt and SysML file pairs and exposes them to the LLM as context~\cite{cibrian2025sysmlagent}. Both approaches rely on context-free grammar (CFG) parsing as the primary basis for syntactic validation and as the primary acceptance metric.

In parallel, SysMBench has established a common benchmark for evaluating natural-language--to--SysML generation quality, especially on semantic alignment criteria~\cite{jin2025sysmbench}. Read together, the current state of the art suggests that generating SysMLv2 from natural language that passes grammar-parser checks is feasible.

Grammar parsability guarantees structural conformance to SysMLv2 context-free syntax: valid token ordering, balanced delimiters, and production-rule-compliant declarations. It does \emph{not} guarantee production validation acceptance, because industrial validators enforce additional model-wide constraints such as name resolution, type consistency, ownership/composition rules, multiplicity constraints, and cross-reference integrity. Therefore, parser-passing outputs provide no assurance that they will be accepted by a production modeling environment for downstream use, including visualization, semantic validation, simulation, and optimization. Without acceptance under a full industrial validator, such models remain unusable in practice. In an auxiliary repository demonstration, we show ten distinct cases that pass SysML ANTLR parsing but fail production validation, empirically reinforcing this distinction~\cite{antlrVsSysideDemo2026}. The critical gap is reliable generation of \emph{production-validator--accepted} SysMLv2 from arbitrary natural-language prompts.

To close this gap, we instantiate a generate--verify--refine workflow in which candidate SysMLv2 models are iteratively evaluated against a production validation backend and revised until acceptance. This paradigm is not novel in itself. It draws from established traditions in formal methods and inductive synthesis, where candidate artifacts are proposed, evaluated by an external oracle, and corrected using deterministic feedback from that oracle~\cite{clarke2000cegar,solarlezama2008thesis,jha2010ogis,alur2013sygus}. Our contribution is to operationalize this verification-driven pattern for natural-language--to--SysMLv2 generation under industry-facing acceptance criteria.

Related work in code generation has already demonstrated the technical value of iterative verifier-in-the-loop refinement. Wang et al.\ show that deterministic compiler diagnostics can be used as structured correction signals in multi-stage neural code generation, improving acceptance of generated programs under executable checks~\cite{wang2022compilable}. Grubi{\v{s}}i{\'c} et al.\ similarly use compiler feedback to iteratively refine LLM outputs, treating validator responses as an explicit control signal for subsequent generations~\cite{grubisic2024compiler}. Taken together, these works establish the core mechanism we rely on: generate a candidate, evaluate it with a deterministic backend, feed diagnostics back into the next iteration, and repeat until the validator reports no remaining errors.

We apply this principle directly to MBSE. Our framework places a production SysMLv2 syntax validator, SysIDE~\cite{sensmetry2024syside}, in the loop as a deterministic oracle, and generation proceeds until zero-error acceptance is achieved under that validator. At convergence, the resulting model is production-ready and operational within the modeling environment---loadable, renderable, analyzable, and suitable for downstream verification workflows. By elevating production-validator acceptance to the convergence criterion, SysMLv2 generation moves from syntactic plausibility to deployable modeling infrastructure, establishing a practical foundation for Copilot-like support in MBSE workflows.

\section{Related Work --- NEEDS A LOT OF WORK -- CHANCES LOWEST PRIORITY}

Our review focuses on prior efforts in automated SysML v2 generation, grammar-constrained structured synthesis, and validator-guided iterative refinement, with an emphasis on approaches addressing reliable syntactic correctness in low-data modeling languages.

\subsection{LLM-Based SysML v2 Model Generation}
Recent work has explored using large language models to generate SysML v2 models from natural language. Bouamra et al.~\cite{bouamra2025systemp} propose SysTemp, a multi-agent framework that decomposes generation into requirement extraction, template-based skeleton construction, and grammar-level parsing feedback. Two specialist agents structure the flow: a \textit{TemplateGeneratorAgent} uses a Jinja2-backed template tool to construct a syntactically organized SysMLv2 skeleton, and a \textit{ParserAgent} validates the generated text against formal SysMLv2 grammar and returns diagnostics to a writer agent for iterative repair~\cite{bouamra2025systemp}. This work demonstrates that structural scaffolding and agent decomposition improve grammar conformity in sparse-data settings, with syntactic acceptance anchored to context-free grammar (CFG) parsing. However, syntactic correctness is defined at the grammar level and convergence is reported empirically rather than enforced as a termination invariant.

Cibrián et al.~\cite{cibrian2025sysmlagent} introduce a distinct agentic architecture in \emph{Computers in Industry}: generation is orchestrated in an agentic loop with a RAG-based context engine and a validation engine (for grammar-level checking), using ANTLR-generated CFG parsing as the syntactic acceptance mechanism. Their context engine retrieves semantically similar natural-language and SysML exemplar pairs to condition generation~\cite{cibrian2025sysmlagent}. Their approach reports 100\% syntactic validity across 20 curated prompts under grammar-level parsing. While this represents a significant advance in structured generation reliability, correctness is enforced through grammar parsing rather than full production validation. Because grammar-level validation ensures context-free structural conformity but does not enforce full static semantics under a production modeling environment, grammar-valid models may still fail production validation in practice.
Together, these efforts establish that iterative validation substantially improves syntactic success in SysML v2 generation. However, prior systems define correctness primarily at the grammar level and evaluate on limited scenario sets. For industry use, the unresolved gap is generalizable \emph{production-validator--accepted} syntactic correctness across diverse prompts. An additional gap is retrieval dependence: pipelines that require semantically similar NL-SysML exemplars may be less generalizable when comparable examples are sparse or unavailable. Our work builds on these insights while shifting the correctness oracle from grammar parsing to a production SysMLv2 validator and scaling evaluation to benchmark-level scenarios.

\subsection{Grammar-Constrained and Template-Based Structured Synthesis}

Structured synthesis approaches aim to reduce hallucinations in LLM output by constraining generation via templates or grammar rules. SysTemp~\cite{bouamra2025systemp} explicitly uses a template generator based on Jinja2 to construct syntactically compliant model skeletons prior to completion. Grammar-constrained decoding and post-generation parsing similarly reduce token-level structural invalidity.

While grammar validation ensures adherence to context-free rules, it does not enforce type resolution, cross-reference integrity, constraint satisfaction, or production modeling environment compatibility. Thus, grammar-valid artifacts may remain unusable within industrial MBSE workflows. Concretely, a model such as \texttt{port p: UndefinedType;} can be grammar-parsable yet fail production validation because the referenced type is unresolved; conversely, a missing delimiter (e.g., omitted semicolon) fails parsing before production validation semantics are even checked. Our approach differs by treating grammar conformity as necessary but insufficient and requiring full production validation acceptance prior to termination.

\subsection{Validator-in-the-Loop and Verifier-Guided Generation}

Prior work in neural code generation has explored leveraging compiler diagnostics to improve the compilability of model outputs. For example, Wang et al.~\cite{wang2022compilable} propose a multi-stage refinement framework that uses compiler feedback to iteratively revise generated programs and increase compilation success rates. Such approaches demonstrate that deterministic compiler signals can serve as effective supervisory feedback in programming-language settings. However, these systems operate in mature programming ecosystems and treat compilation success as an empirical objective rather than as a structural termination invariant.

Beyond compiler-feedback approaches in code generation, iterative generation guided by deterministic verifiers has also been studied under counterexample-guided inductive synthesis and execution-based refinement paradigms. Grubišić et al.~\cite{grubisic2024compiler} demonstrate that LLVM compiler feedback can serve as a supervisory signal for refining LLM-generated intermediate representation. Their work shows that deterministic compilation signals constrain output space and improve structural validity in programming languages.

While these approaches establish the feasibility of compiler-aware refinement in software domains, they differ in both objective and context from model-based systems engineering. Compiler feedback in such systems is typically used to improve optimization quality or increase compilation probability, rather than to enforce strict termination conditions. Moreover, these methods operate in programming languages with extensive training corpora and stable ecosystems.

In contrast, our work applies validator-in-the-loop refinement to SysMLv2, a newly standardized modeling language with sparse representation in LLM training data and strict production-validation requirements. Rather than treating validation results as heuristic feedback, we enforce zero-error acceptance under a production SysMLv2 validator (invoked via \texttt{syside check}) as a termination invariant. This elevates syntactic correctness from an empirical metric to a property guaranteed by construction, aligning generation reliability with production MBSE modeling-environment criteria rather than grammar-level approximations.

\section{Discussion}
We discuss why deterministic validator diagnostics provide an effective supervision signal for new, sparsely represented languages like SysMLv2, and the resulting trade-offs in runtime and number of iterations.

\section{Conclusion}
We present a reproducible pathway for reliable natural-language to SysMLv2 translation by embedding deterministic production-validator feedback into LLM generation, thereby guaranteeing syntactically valid, production-validator--accepted output by construction.
