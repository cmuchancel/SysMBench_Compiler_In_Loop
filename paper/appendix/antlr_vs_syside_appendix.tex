\section{Auxiliary Demonstration: Grammar Parsability vs. Production Validation}
\label{appendix:antlr_vs_syside}

To support the design choice of using production validation (rather than grammar parsing alone) as the acceptance oracle, we ran an auxiliary demonstration included in the repository under \texttt{experiments/antlr\_vs\_syside/}~\cite{antlrVsSysideDemo2026}. This demonstration is not a second primary experiment; it is a construct-validity check showing that parser acceptance and production acceptance are distinct outcomes.

We evaluated 10 intentionally distinct SysMLv2 examples in \texttt{examples/mismatch\_10\_distinct/}. Each file was designed to remain grammar-parseable while violating a model-wide constraint typically enforced by a production validator. The evaluation pipeline was:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ANTLR parse check (third-party SysML parser integration in the repository).
    \item Production validation check using SysIDE.
\end{enumerate}

Results were unambiguous: all 10/10 examples passed ANTLR parsing, while 0/10 were accepted by production validation (10/10 mismatch cases). Validator diagnostics were dominated by unresolved-reference failures (9/10, \texttt{reference-error}), with one invocation-typing failure (1/10, \texttt{invocation-expression-instantiated-type}). This pattern directly illustrates that context-free syntax conformance is necessary but not sufficient for operational model acceptance in production modeling environments.
