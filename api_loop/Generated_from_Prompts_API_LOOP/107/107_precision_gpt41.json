  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerDynamicCouplingSystem' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def VehicleFrame;\n\tpart def HitchBall;\n\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\tpart def Trailer;\n\tpart def TrailerFrame;\n\tconnection def TrailerHitch {\n\t\tend hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\tend coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpart 'vehicle-trailer system' {\n\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\t\tpart vehicleFrame : VehicleFrame {\n\t\t\t\tpart hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tconnection trailerHitch : TrailerHitch[0..1]\n\t\t\tconnect vehicle.vehicleFrame.hitch to trailer.trailerFrame.coupler;\n\t\tpart trailer : Trailer {\n\t\t\tpart trailerFrame : TrailerFrame {\n\t\t\t\tpart coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\taction {\n\t\t\taction 'connect trailer to vehicle'\n\t\t\t\tassign 'vehicle-trailer system'.trailerHitch := TrailerHitch();\n\t\t\tthen action 'destroy connection of trailer to vehicle' : \n\t\t\t\tOccurrenceFunctions::destroy {\n\t\t\t\tinout occ = 'vehicle-trailer system'.trailerHitch;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tthen action 'disconnect trailer from vehicle'\n\t\t\t\tassign 'vehicle-trailer system'.trailerHitch := null;\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\t\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage TrailerHitchingSystem {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n  enum def ConnectionState {\n    enum Connected;\n    enum Disconnected;\n  }\n  port def PowerPort {\n  }\n  part def Frame {\n  }\n  part def HitchBall {\n    port powerPort : PowerPort;\n  }\n  part def TrailerCoupler {\n    port powerPort : PowerPort;\n  }\n  part def Vehicle {\n    part vehicleFrame : Frame;\n    part hitchBall : HitchBall;\n  }\n  part def Trailer {\n    part trailerFrame : Frame;\n    part trailerCoupler : TrailerCoupler;\n  }\n  part def HitchingSystem {\n    part vehicle : Vehicle;\n    part trailer : Trailer;\n    attribute connectionState : ConnectionState = ConnectionState::Disconnected;\n    connect vehicle.hitchBall.powerPort to trailer.trailerCoupler.powerPort;\n  }\n  part system : HitchingSystem;\n}\n\nOutput:",
