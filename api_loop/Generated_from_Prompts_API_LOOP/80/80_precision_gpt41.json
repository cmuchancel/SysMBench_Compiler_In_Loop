  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'EngineConfigurationVariants' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::Real;\n\tprivate import SI::mm;\n\tattribute def Diameter :> ISQ::LengthValue;\n    part def Cylinder {\n        attribute diameter : Diameter[1];\n    }\n    part def Engine {\n    \tpart cylinder : Cylinder[2..*];\n    }\n    part '4cylEngine' : Engine {\n    \tpart redefines cylinder[4];\n    }\n    part '6cylEngine' : Engine {\n    \tpart redefines cylinder[6];\n    }\n\tvariation attribute def DiameterChoices :> Diameter {\n\t\tvariant attribute diameterSmall = 70[mm];\n\t\tvariant attribute diameterLarge = 100[mm];\n\t}\n\tvariation part def EngineChoices :> Engine {\n\t\tvariant '4cylEngine';\n\t\tvariant '6cylEngine';\t\t\n\t}\t\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage EngineConfig {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def CylinderDiameter { d70; d100; }\n  enum def CylinderCount { four; six; }\n\n  part def Cylinder {\n    attribute diameter : CylinderDiameter;\n  }\n\n  part def ConfigurableEngine {\n    attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount;\n    attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter;\n  }\n\n  part def FourCylinderEngine {\n    part cyl1 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl2 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl3 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl4 : Cylinder;\n    attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount = CylinderCount::four;\n    attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter;\n  }\n\n  part def SixCylinderEngine {\n    part cyl1 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl2 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl3 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl4 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl5 : Cylinder;\n    part cyl6 : Cylinder;\n    attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount = CylinderCount::six;\n    attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter;\n  }\n\n  part configurableEngine : ConfigurableEngine;\n  part fourCylinderEngine : FourCylinderEngine;\n  part sixCylinderEngine : SixCylinderEngine;\n}\n\nOutput:",

Not exactly the same, but the intent (importing scalar values) is present → **Supported**\n3. **Enum CylinderDiameter (d70, d100)**: Reference model uses a variation attribute with values 70[mm], 100[mm]. The enum is a different encoding, but semantically equivalent → **Supported**\n4. **Enum CylinderCount (four, six)**: Reference model uses part multiplicity and variation parts for 4 and 6 cylinders.

The generated model uses an enum instead, but both model the diameter attribute → **Supported**\n7. **Part ConfigurableEngine exists**: Reference model does not have a direct equivalent; it has `Engine` and variation part `EngineChoices`. `ConfigurableEngine` is a merged/parameterized version. Not directly supported → **Not Supported**\n8. **ConfigurableEngine has attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount**: Reference model uses part multiplicity and variation, not an explicit attribute. Not directly supported → **Not Supported**\n9. **ConfigurableEngine has attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter**: Reference model uses variation attribute for diameter, not an explicit attribute on Engine.

Not directly supported → **Not Supported**\n13. **FourCylinderEngine has attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter**: Reference model does not have this attribute on the part, but the diameter is set via variation attribute. Not directly supported → **Not Supported**\n14. **Part SixCylinderEngine exists**: Reference model has `'6cylEngine' : Engine` as a variant → **Supported**\n15. **SixCylinderEngine has parts cyl1..cyl6 : Cylinder**: Reference model uses `part redefines cylinder[6]`, which is equivalent → **Supported**\n16. **SixCylinderEngine has attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount = six**: Reference model does not have an explicit attribute, but the variant implies 6 cylinders. Not directly supported → **Not Supported**\n17. **SixCylinderEngine has attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter**: Reference model does not have this attribute on the part, but the diameter is set via variation attribute.
