  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleAssemblyProcessModeling' {\n\tpublic import Definitions::*;\n\tpackage Definitions {\n\t\titem def VehicleAssembly;\n\t\titem def AssembledVehicle :> VehicleAssembly;\n\t\tpart def Vehicle :> AssembledVehicle;\t\t\n\t\tpart def Transmission;\n\t\tpart def Engine;\t\t\n\t}\n\tpackage Usages {\t\n\t\tpart AssemblyLine {\n\t\t\tperform action 'assemble vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\taction 'assemble transmission into vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\t\tin item 'vehicle assy without transmission or engine' : VehicleAssembly;\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tin item transmission : Transmission {\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tout item 'vehicle assy without engine' : VehicleAssembly = 'vehicle assy without transmission or engine' {\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart transmission : Transmission = 'assemble transmission into vehicle'.transmission {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tflow 'assemble transmission into vehicle'.'vehicle assy without engine' \n\t\t\t\t    to 'assemble engine into vehicle'.'vehicle assy without engine';\n\t\t\t\taction 'assemble engine into vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\t\tin item 'vehicle assy without engine' : VehicleAssembly {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart transmission : Transmission;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tin item engine : Engine;\n\t\t\t\t\tout item assembledVehicle : AssembledVehicle = 'vehicle assy without engine' {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart engine : Engine = 'assemble engine into vehicle'.engine;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tbind 'assemble vehicle'.'assemble engine into vehicle'.assembledVehicle = vehicle;\n\t\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\t\t\tpart transmission: Transmission;\n\t\t\t\tpart engine: Engine;\n\t\t\t\tperform action providePower;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage AutomobileAssembly {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  part def Gearbox;\n  part def Engine;\n\n  part def VehicleWithoutGearboxEngine;\n  part def VehicleWithGearbox {\n    part gearbox : Gearbox;\n  }\n  part def FullyAssembledVehicle {\n    part gearbox : Gearbox;\n    part engine : Engine;\n  }\n\n  port def VehicleWithoutGearboxIn {\n    attribute vehicle : VehicleWithoutGearboxEngine;\n  }\n  port def GearboxIn {\n    attribute gearbox : Gearbox;\n  }\n  port def VehicleWithGearboxIn {\n    attribute vehicle : VehicleWithGearbox;\n  }\n  port def VehicleWithGearboxOut {\n    attribute vehicle : VehicleWithGearbox;\n  }\n  port def EngineIn {\n    attribute engine : Engine;\n  }\n  port def FullyAssembledVehicleOut {\n    attribute vehicle : FullyAssembledVehicle;\n  }\n\n  part def GearboxInstallation {\n    port inVehicle : VehicleWithoutGearboxIn;\n    port inGearbox : GearboxIn;\n    port outVehicle : VehicleWithGearboxOut;\n  }\n\n  part def EngineInstallation {\n    port inVehicle : VehicleWithGearboxIn;\n    port inEngine : EngineIn;\n    port outVehicle : FullyAssembledVehicleOut;\n  }\n\n  part def FinalAssemblyLine {\n    port inVehicle : VehicleWithoutGearboxIn;\n    port inGearbox : GearboxIn;\n    port inEngine : EngineIn;\n    port outVehicle : FullyAssembledVehicleOut;\n\n    part step1 : GearboxInstallation;\n    part step2 : EngineInstallation;\n\n    connect inVehicle to step1.inVehicle;\n    connect inGearbox to step1.inGearbox;\n    connect step1.outVehicle to step2.inVehicle;\n    connect inEngine to step2.inEngine;\n    connect step2.outVehicle to outVehicle;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
