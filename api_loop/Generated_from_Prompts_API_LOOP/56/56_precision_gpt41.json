List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage MassRollup{\n\tprivate import NumericalFunctions::*;\n\tpart def MassedThing {\n\t\tattribute simpleMass :> ISQ::mass; \n\t\tattribute totalMass :> ISQ::mass;\n\t}\n\tpart simpleThing : MassedThing {\n\t\tattribute :>> totalMass = simpleMass;\n\t}\n\tpart compositeThing : MassedThing {\n\t\tpart subcomponents: MassedThing[*];\t\t\n\t\tattribute :>> totalMass =\n\t\t\tsimpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass); \n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage MassAggregation {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n  part def ObjectWithMass {\n    attribute simpleMass : Real;\n    attribute subcomponentsTotalMass : Real = 0;\n    attribute totalMass : Real = simpleMass + subcomponentsTotalMass;\n  }\n  part def simpleThing specializes ObjectWithMass {\n  }\n  part def compositeThing specializes ObjectWithMass {\n    part subcomponents : ObjectWithMass [*];\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
