  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleComposition' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute mass : Real;\n\t\tattribute status : VehicleStatus;\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t\tref part driver : Person;\n\t}\n\tattribute def VehicleStatus {\n\t\tattribute gearSetting : Integer;\n\t\tattribute acceleratorPosition : Real;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Person;\n\tindividual part def Vehicle_1 :> Vehicle {\n\t\tsnapshot part vehicle_1_t0 {\n\t\t\t:>> mass = 2000.0;\n\t\t\t:>> status {\n\t\t\t\t:>> gearSetting = 0;\n\t\t\t\t:>> acceleratorPosition = 0.0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tsnapshot part vehicle_1_t1 {\n\t\t\t:>> mass = 1500.0;\n\t\t\t:>> status {\n\t\t\t\t:>> gearSetting = 2;\n\t\t\t\t:>> acceleratorPosition = 0.5;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tfirst vehicle_1_t0 then vehicle_1_t1;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleComposite {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  part def Engine {\n  }\n\n  part def Driver {\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    attribute mass : Real;\n    attribute gear : Integer;\n    attribute accelerator : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleTimeline {\n    part initial : Vehicle;\n    part next : Vehicle;\n  }\n\n  part def CompositeSystem {\n    part vehicle_1 : VehicleTimeline;\n    part engine_1 : Engine;\n    part driver_1 : Driver;\n  }\n\n  part SystemInstance : CompositeSystem {\n    part vehicle_1 : VehicleTimeline {\n      part initial : Vehicle {\n        attribute mass = 2000.0;\n        attribute gear = 0;\n        attribute accelerator = 0.0;\n      }\n      part next : Vehicle {\n        attribute mass = 1500.0;\n        attribute gear = 2;\n        attribute accelerator = 0.5;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
