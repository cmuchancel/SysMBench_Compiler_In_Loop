List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3.

Definition of part/item `Fuel`.\n- 11. Definition of part `FuelTankAssembly`.\n- 13. Definition of part `Engine`.\n- 20. `vehicle` has part `tankAssy` of type `FuelTankAssembly`.\n- 21. `vehicle` has part `eng` of type `Engine`.\n\n**Partial or not covered:**\n- All others are either partial (structure is somewhat present but not matching the reference claim exactly) or not present at all.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
