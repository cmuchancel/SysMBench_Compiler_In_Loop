  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleMessagePayload' {\n\tpart def Driver;\n\tpart def CruiseController;\n\tpart def Speedometer;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart driver : Driver {\n\t\tevent occurrence setSpeedSent;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart cruiseController : CruiseController {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence setSpeedReceived;\t\t\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence sensedSpeedReceived;\t\t\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence fuelCommandSent;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart speedometer : Speedometer {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence sensedSpeedSent;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart engine : Engine {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence fuelCommandReceived;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\titem def SetSpeed;\n\titem def SensedSpeed;\n\titem def FuelCommand {\n\t\tattribute fuelFlow : ScalarValues::Real;\n\t}\n\tpart def EngineController;\n\tpart vehicle1 :> vehicle {\n\t\tpart engineController : EngineController {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence fuelCommandReceived;\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence fuelCommandForwarded;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\toccurrence def CruiseControlInteraction {\t\t\n\t\tref part :>> driver;\t\t\n\t\tref part vehicle :>> vehicle1;\n\t\tmessage setSpeedMessage of SetSpeed \n\t\t\tfrom driver.setSpeedSent to vehicle.cruiseController.setSpeedReceived;\n\t\tthen message sensedSpeedMessage of SensedSpeed \n\t\t\tfrom vehicle.speedometer.sensedSpeedSent to vehicle.cruiseController.sensedSpeedReceived;\n\t\tthen message fuelCommandMessage of fuelCommand : FuelCommand \n\t\t\tfrom vehicle.cruiseController.fuelCommandSent to vehicle.engineController.fuelCommandReceived;\n\t\tthen message fuelCommandForwardingMessage of fuelCommand : FuelCommand = fuelCommandMessage.fuelCommand\n\t\t\tfrom vehicle.engineController.fuelCommandForwarded to vehicle.engine.fuelCommandReceived;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage CruiseControlSystemPkg {\n   private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n   item def SetSpeedCommand {\n      attribute setSpeed : Real;\n   }\n\n   item def SpeedReading {\n      attribute speed : Real;\n   }\n\n   item def FuelControlCommand {\n      attribute fuelRate : Real;\n   }\n\n   port def SetSpeedPort {\n      attribute cmd : SetSpeedCommand;\n   }\n\n   port def SpeedPort {\n      attribute reading : SpeedReading;\n   }\n\n   port def FuelCommandPort {\n      attribute fuelCmd : FuelControlCommand;\n   }\n\n   part def Driver {\n      port setSpeedOut : SetSpeedPort;\n      attribute desiredSpeed : Real;\n   }\n\n   part def CruiseController {\n      port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort;\n      port speedIn : SpeedPort;\n      port fuelCmdOut : FuelCommandPort;\n      attribute setSpeed : Real;\n      attribute actualSpeed : Real;\n   }\n\n   part def SpeedSensor {\n      port speedOut : SpeedPort;\n      attribute measuredSpeed : Real;\n   }\n\n   part def EngineController {\n      port fuelCmdIn : FuelCommandPort;\n      port fuelCmdOut : FuelCommandPort;\n   }\n\n   part def Engine {\n      port fuelCmdIn : FuelCommandPort;\n      attribute fuelFlow : Real;\n   }\n\n   part def CruiseControlSystem {\n      part driver : Driver;\n      part cruiseController : CruiseController;\n      part speedSensor : SpeedSensor;\n      part engineController : EngineController;\n      part engine : Engine;\n\n      connect driver.setSpeedOut to cruiseController.setSpeedIn;\n      connect speedSensor.speedOut to cruiseController.speedIn;\n      connect cruiseController.fuelCmdOut to engineController.fuelCmdIn;\n      connect engineController.fuelCmdOut to engine.fuelCmdIn;\n   }\n}\n\nOutput:",
