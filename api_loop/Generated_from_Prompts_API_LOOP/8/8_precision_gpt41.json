  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleDefinition' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\titem def Fuel;\n\titem def Person;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute mass : Real;\n\t\tref item driver : Person;\n\t\tpart fuelTank {\n\t\t\titem fuel: Fuel;\n\t\t}\t\t\n\t}\t\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleModeling {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def FuelType {\n    enum Gasoline;\n    enum Diesel;\n    enum Electric;\n    enum Hydrogen;\n  }\n\n  part def Fuel {\n    attribute fuelType : FuelType;\n    attribute description : String;\n  }\n\n  part def Personnel {\n    attribute name : String;\n    attribute personnelId : String;\n  }\n\n  part def Driver {\n    part info : Personnel;\n    attribute licenseId : String;\n  }\n\n  part def QualityAttributes {\n    attribute safetyLevel : String;\n    attribute reliabilityLevel : String;\n  }\n\n  part def FuelTank {\n    part storedFuel : Fuel;\n    attribute capacity : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    attribute model : String;\n    part quality : QualityAttributes;\n    part driver : Driver;\n    part fuelTank : FuelTank;\n  }\n\n  part def DataRepository {\n    part fuelInfo : Fuel;\n    part personnelInfo : Personnel;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleModelingSystem {\n    part vehicle : Vehicle;\n    part data : DataRepository;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
