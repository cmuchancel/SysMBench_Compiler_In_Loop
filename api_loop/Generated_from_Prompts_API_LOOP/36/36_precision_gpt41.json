List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleStateManagement' {\n\tattribute def VehicleStartSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleOnSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleOffSignal;\n\tstate def VehicleStates {\n\t\tentry; then off;\n\t\tstate off;\n\t\taccept VehicleStartSignal \n\t\t\tthen starting;\n\t\tstate starting;\n\t\taccept VehicleOnSignal\n\t\t\tthen on;\n\t\tstate on;\n\t\taccept VehicleOffSignal\n\t\t\tthen off;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleStateManagement {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n    enum def VehicleState {\n        enum off;\n        enum starting;\n        enum on;\n    }\n    enum def VehicleControlSignal {\n        enum VehicleStartSignal;\n        enum VehicleOnSignal;\n        enum VehicleOffSignal;\n    }\n    port def ControlSignalPort {\n        attribute signal : VehicleControlSignal;\n    }\n    part def VehicleStatusManager {\n        attribute currentState : VehicleState = VehicleState::off;\n        attribute lastSignal : VehicleControlSignal;\n        port controlIn : ControlSignalPort;\n    }\n    part vehicleSystem : VehicleStatusManager;\n}\n\nOutput:",
