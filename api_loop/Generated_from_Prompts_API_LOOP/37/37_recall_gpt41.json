  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehiclePowerManagement' {\n\tattribute def VehicleStartSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleOnSignal;\n\tattribute def VehicleOffSignal;\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\taction performSelfTest { in vehicle : Vehicle; }\n\tstate def VehicleStates { in operatingVehicle : Vehicle; }\n\tstate vehicleStates : VehicleStates {\n\t\tin operatingVehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tentry; then off;\n\t\tstate off;\n\t\taccept VehicleStartSignal \n\t\t\tthen starting;\n\t\tstate starting;\n\t\taccept VehicleOnSignal\n\t\t\tthen on;\n\t\tstate on {\n\t\t\tentry performSelfTest{ in vehicle = operatingVehicle; }\n\t\t\tdo action providePower { /* ... */ }\n\t\t\texit action applyParkingBrake { /* ... */ }\n\t\t}\n\t\taccept VehicleOffSignal\n\t\t\tthen off;\n\t}\t\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehiclePowerManagement {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def PowerState {\n    enum Off;\n    enum StartPhase;\n    enum PoweredOn;\n  }\n\n  port def ControlPort {\n    attribute startCommand : Boolean;\n    attribute startedSignal : Boolean;\n    attribute shutdownCommand : Boolean;\n  }\n\n  port def PowerPort {\n    attribute supplyOn : Boolean;\n  }\n\n  part def User {\n    port controlOut : ControlPort;\n  }\n\n  part def FunctionalUnit {\n    port powerIn : PowerPort;\n    attribute unitName : String;\n  }\n\n  part def VehiclePowerSystem {\n    port controlIn : ControlPort;\n    port powerOut : PowerPort;\n    attribute powerState : PowerState = PowerState::Off;\n    attribute selfDiagnosisActive : Boolean = false;\n    attribute parkingBrakeEngaged : Boolean = false;\n    attribute powerSupplyOn : Boolean = false;\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    part powerSystem : VehiclePowerSystem;\n    part propulsionUnit : FunctionalUnit;\n    part infotainmentUnit : FunctionalUnit;\n    part safetyUnit : FunctionalUnit;\n\n    connect powerSystem.powerOut to propulsionUnit.powerIn;\n    connect powerSystem.powerOut to infotainmentUnit.powerIn;\n    connect powerSystem.powerOut to safetyUnit.powerIn;\n  }\n\n  part def VehiclePowerManagementSystem {\n    part user : User;\n    part vehicle : Vehicle;\n\n    connect user.controlOut to vehicle.powerSystem.controlIn;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
