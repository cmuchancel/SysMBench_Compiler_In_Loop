  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'WheelAssemblyStructure' {\n\tpart def WheelHubAssembly;\n\tpart def WheelAssembly;\n\tpart def Tire;\n\tpart def TireBead;\n\tpart def Wheel;\n\tpart def TireMountingRim;\n\tpart def LugBoltMountingHole;\n\tpart def Hub;\n\tpart def LugBoltThreadableHole;\n\tpart def LugBoltJoint;\n\tconnection def PressureSeat {\n\t\tend bead : TireBead[1];\n\t\tend mountingRim : TireMountingRim[1];\n\t}\n\tpart wheelHubAssembly : WheelHubAssembly {\n\t\t\n\t\tpart wheel : WheelAssembly[1] {\n\t\t\tpart t : Tire[1] {\n\t\t\t\tpart bead : TireBead[2];\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart w: Wheel[1] {\n\t\t\t\tpart rim : TireMountingRim[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart mountingHoles : LugBoltMountingHole[5];\n\t\t\t}\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tconnection : PressureSeat \n\t\t\t\tconnect bead references t.bead \n\t\t\t\tto mountingRim references w.rim;\t\t\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart lugBoltJoints : LugBoltJoint[0..5];\n\t\tpart hub : Hub[1] {\n\t\t\tpart h : LugBoltThreadableHole[5];\n\t\t}\n\t\tconnect lugBoltJoints[0..1] to wheel.w.mountingHoles[1];\n\t\tconnect lugBoltJoints[0..1] to hub.h[1];\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage WheelAssemblyModel {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  part def WheelBearingUnit { }\n  part def Bead { }\n  part def Tire {\n    part bead1 : Bead;\n    part bead2 : Bead;\n  }\n  part def Bolt { }\n  part def BoltMountingHole { }\n  part def ThreadedHole { }\n  part def Rim {\n    part boltMountingHole1 : BoltMountingHole;\n    part boltMountingHole2 : BoltMountingHole;\n  }\n  part def Hub {\n    part threadedHole1 : ThreadedHole;\n    part threadedHole2 : ThreadedHole;\n  }\n\n  part def WheelAssembly {\n    part bearingUnit : WheelBearingUnit;\n    part hub : Hub;\n    part rimA : Rim;\n    part rimB : Rim;\n    part tire : Tire;\n    part bolt1 : Bolt;\n    part bolt2 : Bolt;\n\n    connect bearingUnit to hub;\n    connect tire.bead1 to rimA;\n    connect tire.bead2 to rimB;\n    connect rimA.boltMountingHole1 to bolt1;\n    connect hub.threadedHole1 to bolt1;\n    connect rimA.boltMountingHole2 to bolt2;\n    connect hub.threadedHole2 to bolt2;\n  }\n\n  part wheelAssembly : WheelAssembly;\n}\n\nOutput:",
