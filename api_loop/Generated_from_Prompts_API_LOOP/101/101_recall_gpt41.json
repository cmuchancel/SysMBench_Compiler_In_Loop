  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerCouplingSystemModeling' {\n\tpackage Definitions {\n\t\tpart def Vehicle;\n\t\tpart def Trailer;\n\t\tpart def TrailerHitch;\n\t\tpart def HitchBall;\n\t\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpackage Usages {\n\t\tprivate import Definitions::*;\n\t\tpart vehicle_trailer_system {\n\t\t\tpart vehicle1_c1: Vehicle {\n\t\t\t\tref hitchBall : HitchBall {\n\t\t\t\t\t/*\n\t\t\t\t\t * 'vehicle1_c1'::'hitchBall' is a reference property that\n\t\t\t\t\t * references a hitch ball that is not part of this vehicle. \n\t\t\t\t\t * If 'vehicle1_c1' is removed or destroyed, this does not\n\t\t\t\t\t * effect the hitchBall referenced here.\n\t\t\t\t\t */\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tbind vehicle1_c1.hitchBall = trailerHitch.hitchBall {\n\t\t\t\t/*\n\t\t\t\t * This is a binding connector between the 'hitchBall' in 'vehicle1_c1'\n\t\t\t\t * and the 'hitchBall' in 'trailerHitch'.\n\t\t\t\t */\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart trailerHitch: TrailerHitch {\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tpart hitchBall: HitchBall;\n\t\t\t\tpart trailerCoupler: TrailerCoupler;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart trailer1: Trailer {\n\t\t\t\tref trailerCoupler : TrailerCoupler = trailerHitch.trailerCoupler {\n\t\t\t\t\t/*\n\t\t\t\t\t * This is a shorthand for a binding connector between the\n\t\t\t\t\t * 'trailerCoupler' here and the 'trailerCoupler' in 'trailerHitch'.\n\t\t\t\t\t * The binding connector is now contained within the 'trailer1'\n\t\t\t\t\t * part, though, rather than being at the system level. \n\t\t\t\t\t */\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage CouplingSystemModel {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    port def CouplingPort;\n\n    part def Ball;\n\n    part def Hitch {\n        part ball: Ball;\n        port couplingPort: CouplingPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        port hitchPort: CouplingPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Trailer {\n        port couplingPort: CouplingPort;\n    }\n\n    part def CouplingSystem {\n        part vehicle: Vehicle;\n        part trailer: Trailer;\n        part hitch: Hitch;\n        connect vehicle.hitchPort to hitch.couplingPort;\n        connect trailer.couplingPort to hitch.couplingPort;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
