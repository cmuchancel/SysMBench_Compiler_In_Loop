List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleProductLineConfiguration' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::Real;\n\tprivate import SI::mm;\n\tattribute def Diameter :> ISQ::LengthValue;\n    part def Cylinder {\n        attribute diameter : Diameter[1];\n    }\n    part def Engine {\n    \tpart cylinder : Cylinder[2..*];\n    }\n    part '4cylEngine' : Engine {\n    \tpart redefines cylinder[4];\n    }\n    part '6cylEngine' : Engine {\n    \tpart redefines cylinder[6];\n    }\n\tvariation attribute def DiameterChoices :> Diameter {\n\t\tvariant attribute diameterSmall = 70[mm];\n\t\tvariant attribute diameterLarge = 100[mm];\n\t}\n\tvariation part def EngineChoices :> Engine {\n\t\tvariant '4cylEngine';\n\t\tvariant '6cylEngine';\t\t\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def Transmission;\n\tpart manualTransmission;\n\tpart automaticTransmission;\n\tabstract part vehicleFamily : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart engine : EngineChoices[1];\n\t\tvariation part transmission : Transmission[1] {\n\t\t\tvariant manualTransmission;\n\t\t\tvariant automaticTransmission;\n\t\t}\n\t\tassert constraint {\n\t\t\t(engine == engine::'4cylEngine' and\n\t\t\t transmission == transmission::manualTransmission) xor\n\t\t\t(engine == engine::'6cylEngine' and \n\t\t\t transmission == transmission::automaticTransmission)\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle4Cyl :> vehicleFamily {\n\t\tpart redefines engine = engine::'4cylEngine';\n\t\tpart redefines transmission = transmission::manualTransmission;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle6Cyl :> vehicleFamily {\n\t\tpart redefines engine = engine::'6cylEngine';\n\t\tpart redefines transmission = transmission::manualTransmission;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleConfig {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  part def Cylinder {\n    attribute diameter : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def SmallCylinder specializes Cylinder {\n    attribute diameter : Real = 70;\n  }\n\n  part def LargeCylinder specializes Cylinder {\n    attribute diameter : Real = 100;\n  }\n\n  part def Engine {\n    attribute cylinderCount : Integer;\n  }\n\n  part def FourCylinderEngine specializes Engine {\n    attribute cylinderCount : Integer = 4;\n    part cylinder1 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder2 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder3 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder4 : Cylinder;\n  }\n\n  part def SixCylinderEngine specializes Engine {\n    attribute cylinderCount : Integer = 6;\n    part cylinder1 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder2 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder3 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder4 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder5 : Cylinder;\n    part cylinder6 : Cylinder;\n  }\n\n  part def Transmission;\n\n  part def ManualTransmission specializes Transmission;\n\n  part def AutomaticTransmission specializes Transmission;\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part transmission : Transmission;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleFourCylinderManual specializes Vehicle {\n    part engine : FourCylinderEngine;\n    part transmission : ManualTransmission;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleFourCylinderAutomatic specializes Vehicle {\n    part engine : FourCylinderEngine;\n    part transmission : AutomaticTransmission;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleSixCylinderAutomatic specializes Vehicle {\n    part engine : SixCylinderEngine;\n    part transmission : AutomaticTransmission;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
