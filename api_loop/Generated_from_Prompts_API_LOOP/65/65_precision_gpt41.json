  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassComplianceSystem' {\n\tprivate import ISQ::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n\tprivate import NumericalFunctions::*;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def Transmission;\n\tconstraint def MassConstraint {\n\t\tattribute partMasses : MassValue[0..*];\n\t\tattribute massLimit : MassValue;\n\t\tsum(partMasses) <= massLimit\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tconstraint massConstraint : MassConstraint {\n\t\t\tredefines partMasses = (chassisMass, engine.mass, transmission.mass);\n\t\t\tredefines massLimit = 2500[kg];\n\t\t}\n\t\tattribute chassisMass : MassValue;\n\t\tpart engine : Engine {\n\t\t\tattribute mass : MassValue;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart transmission : Engine {\n\t\t\tattribute mass : MassValue;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleWeightControl {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def WeightStatus {\n    enum OK;\n    enum OVER_LIMIT;\n  }\n\n  part def Chassis {\n    attribute weight : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Engine {\n    attribute weight : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Transmission {\n    attribute weight : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleWeightManager {\n    part chassis : Chassis;\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part transmission : Transmission;\n    attribute weightLimit : Real = 2500.0;\n    attribute totalWeight : Real = chassis.weight + engine.weight + transmission.weight;\n    attribute warning : Boolean = totalWeight > weightLimit;\n    attribute status : WeightStatus;\n  }\n\n  part vehicleWeightManager : VehicleWeightManager;\n}\n\nOutput:",
