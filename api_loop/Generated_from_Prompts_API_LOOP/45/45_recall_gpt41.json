  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'CruiseControlProtocol' {\n\tpart def Driver;\n\tpart def CruiseController;\n\tpart def Speedometer;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart driver : Driver {\n\t\tevent occurrence setSpeedSent;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart cruiseController : CruiseController {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence setSpeedReceived;\t\t\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence sensedSpeedReceived;\t\t\n\t\t\tthen event occurrence fuelCommandSent;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart speedometer : Speedometer {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence sensedSpeedSent;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart engine : Engine {\n\t\t\tevent occurrence fuelCommandReceived;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\titem def SetSpeed;\n\titem def SensedSpeed;\n\titem def FuelCommand;\n\toccurrence def CruiseControlInteraction {\t\t\n\t\tref part :>> driver;\t\t\n\t\tref part :>> vehicle;\n\t\tmessage setSpeedMessage of SetSpeed \n\t\t\tfrom driver.setSpeedSent to vehicle.cruiseController.setSpeedReceived;\n\t\tmessage sensedSpeedMessage of SensedSpeed \n\t\t\tfrom vehicle.speedometer.sensedSpeedSent to vehicle.cruiseController.sensedSpeedReceived;\n\t\tmessage fuelCommandMessage of FuelCommand \n\t\t\tfrom vehicle.cruiseController.fuelCommandSent to vehicle.engine.fuelCommandReceived;\n\t\tfirst setSpeedMessage then sensedSpeedMessage;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage CruiseControlSystem {\n   private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n   item def SetSpeedCommand {\n      attribute setSpeed : Real;\n   }\n\n   item def VehicleSpeed {\n      attribute speed : Real;\n   }\n\n   item def ThrottleCommand {\n      attribute throttle : Real;\n   }\n\n   port def SetSpeedPort {\n      ref item setSpeed : SetSpeedCommand;\n   }\n\n   port def SpeedPort {\n      ref item speed : VehicleSpeed;\n   }\n\n   port def ThrottlePort {\n      ref item throttle : ThrottleCommand;\n   }\n\n   part def Driver {\n      port setSpeedOut : SetSpeedPort;\n   }\n\n   part def Speedometer {\n      port speedOut : SpeedPort;\n   }\n\n   part def EngineSystem {\n      port throttleIn : ThrottlePort;\n   }\n\n   part def CruiseController {\n      port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort;\n      port speedIn : SpeedPort;\n      port throttleOut : ThrottlePort;\n      attribute targetSpeed : Real;\n      attribute currentSpeed : Real;\n      attribute controlThrottle : Real;\n   }\n\n   part def CruiseControlSystem {\n      part driver : Driver;\n      part speedometer : Speedometer;\n      part engine : EngineSystem;\n      part controller : CruiseController;\n\n      connect driver.setSpeedOut to controller.setSpeedIn;\n      connect speedometer.speedOut to controller.speedIn;\n      connect controller.throttleOut to engine.throttleIn;\n   }\n\n   part system : CruiseControlSystem;\n}\n\nOutput:",
