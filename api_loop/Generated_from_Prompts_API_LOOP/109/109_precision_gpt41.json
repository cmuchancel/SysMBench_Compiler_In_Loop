  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'DynamicTrailerCouplingReferenceModel' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def VehicleFrame;\n\tpart def HitchBall;\n\tpart def Trailer;\n\tpart def TrailerFrame;\n\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart vehicleFrame : VehicleFrame {\n\t\t\tpart hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart trailer : Trailer {\n\t\tpart trailerFrame : TrailerFrame {\n\t\t\tpart coupler : TrailerCoupler {\n\t\t\t\tref part hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\t\t\n\t}\t\t\n\taction {\n\t\taction 'connect trailer to vehicle'\n\t\t\tassign trailer.trailerFrame.coupler.hitch := vehicle.vehicleFrame.hitch;\n\t\tthen action 'disconnect trailer from vehicle'\n\t\t\tassign trailer.trailerFrame.coupler.hitch := null;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage TrailerHitchSystem {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    enum def ConnectionState {\n        enum Connected;\n        enum Disconnected;\n    }\n\n    port def HitchPort;\n\n    part def TowBall {\n        port hitch : HitchPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Coupler {\n        port hitch : HitchPort;\n        attribute canEngage : Boolean = true;\n        attribute canDisengage : Boolean = true;\n        attribute engaged : Boolean = false;\n    }\n\n    part def Chassis {\n    }\n\n    part def TrailerChassis {\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        part chassis : Chassis;\n        part towBall : TowBall;\n    }\n\n    part def Trailer {\n        part trailerChassis : TrailerChassis;\n        part coupler : Coupler;\n    }\n\n    part def VehicleTrailerSystem {\n        part vehicle : Vehicle;\n        part trailer : Trailer;\n        attribute connectionState : ConnectionState = ConnectionState::Disconnected;\n\n        connect vehicle.towBall.hitch to trailer.coupler.hitch;\n    }\n\n    part system : VehicleTrailerSystem;\n}\n\nOutput:",
