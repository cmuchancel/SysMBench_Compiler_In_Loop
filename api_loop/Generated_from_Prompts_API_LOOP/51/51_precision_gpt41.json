  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleComposition' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute mass : Real;\n\t\tattribute status : VehicleStatus;\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t\tref part driver : Person;\n\t}\n\tattribute def VehicleStatus {\n\t\tattribute gearSetting : Integer;\n\t\tattribute acceleratorPosition : Real;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Person;\n\tpart def Wheel;\n\tindividual part def Vehicle_1 :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart leftFrontWheel : Wheel;\n\t\tpart rightFrontWheel : Wheel;\n\t}\n\tindividual part def Wheel_1 :> Wheel;\n\tindividual part vehicle_1 : Vehicle_1 {\n\t\tsnapshot part vehicle_1_t0 {\n\t\t\tsnapshot leftFrontWheel_t0 : Wheel_1 :>> leftFrontWheel;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthen snapshot part vehicle_1_t1 {\n\t\t\tsnapshot rightFrontWheel_t1 : Wheel_1 :>> rightFrontWheel;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleModel {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    enum def GearSetting {\n        enum Park;\n        enum Reverse;\n        enum Neutral;\n        enum Drive;\n    }\n\n    part def OperationalStatus {\n        attribute gearSetting : GearSetting;\n        attribute acceleratorPedalPosition : Real;\n    }\n\n    part def Engine {\n    }\n\n    part def Driver {\n    }\n\n    part def Wheel {\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute isOperational : Boolean;\n        part status : OperationalStatus;\n        part engine : Engine;\n        ref part driver : Driver;\n        part leftFrontWheel : Wheel;\n        part rightFrontWheel : Wheel;\n        part leftRearWheel : Wheel;\n        part rightRearWheel : Wheel;\n    }\n\n    part vehicle_1 : Vehicle {\n        part leftFrontWheel_snapshot1 : Wheel;\n        part rightFrontWheel_snapshot1 : Wheel;\n        part leftFrontWheel_snapshot2 : Wheel;\n        part rightFrontWheel_snapshot2 : Wheel;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
