  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleFuelSystem' {\n\tprivate import 'Port Example'::*;\n\tattribute def Temp;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelOutPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tport def FuelInPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tin item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tout item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTankAssembly {\n\t\tport fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport engineFuelPort : FuelInPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tinterface def FuelInterface {\n\t\tend supplierPort : FuelOutPort;\n\t\tend consumerPort : FuelInPort;\n\t\tflow supplierPort.fuelSupply to consumerPort.fuelSupply;\t\t\t\n\t\tflow consumerPort.fuelReturn to supplierPort.fuelReturn;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\t\n\t\tpart tankAssy : FuelTankAssembly;\t\t\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t\tinterface : FuelInterface connect \n\t\t\tsupplierPort ::> tankAssy.fuelTankPort to \n\t\t\tconsumerPort ::> eng.engineFuelPort;\n\t} \n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleFuelManagement {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  port def FuelPort {\n    attribute fuelTemperature : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def FuelTankAssembly {\n    port outlet : FuelPort;\n    port returnIn : FuelPort;\n  }\n\n  part def EngineUnit {\n    port inlet : FuelPort;\n    port returnOut : FuelPort;\n  }\n\n  part def FuelSystem {\n    part tank : FuelTankAssembly;\n    part engine : EngineUnit;\n\n    connect tank.outlet to engine.inlet;\n    connect engine.returnOut to tank.returnIn;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
