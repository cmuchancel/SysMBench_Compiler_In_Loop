List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleDefinition' {\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart parts : VehiclePart[*];\n\t\tpart eng : Engine subsets parts;\n\t\tpart trans : Transmission subsets parts;\n\t\tpart wheels : Wheel[4] :> parts;\n\t}\n\tabstract part def VehiclePart;\n\tpart def Engine :> VehiclePart;\n\tpart def Transmission :> VehiclePart;\n\tpart def Wheel :> VehiclePart;\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleStructure {\n    part def VehicleComponent;\n    part def Engine specializes VehicleComponent;\n    part def Transmission specializes VehicleComponent;\n    part def Wheel specializes VehicleComponent;\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        part engine : Engine;\n        part transmission : Transmission;\n        part wheels[4] : Wheel;\n    }\n\n    part def Car specializes Vehicle;\n}\n\nOutput:",
