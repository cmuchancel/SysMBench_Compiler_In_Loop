  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleTrailerConnectionStateManagement' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def VehicleFrame;\n\tpart def HitchBall;\n\tpart def TrailerCoupler;\n\tpart def Trailer;\n\tpart def TrailerFrame;\n\tconnection def TrailerHitch {\n\t\tend hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\tend coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t}\n\tpart 'vehicle-trailer system' {\t\n\t\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\t\tpart vehicleFrame : VehicleFrame {\n\t\t\t\tpart hitch : HitchBall;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tconnection trailerHitch : TrailerHitch[0..1]\n\t\t\tconnect vehicle.vehicleFrame.hitch to trailer.trailerFrame.coupler;\n\t\tpart trailer : Trailer {\n\t\t\tpart trailerFrame : TrailerFrame {\n\t\t\t\tpart coupler : TrailerCoupler;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tperform action {\n\t\t\taction 'connect trailer to vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\tabstract ref :>> trailerHitch[1];\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tthen action 'disconnect trailer from vehicle' {\n\t\t\t\tabstract ref :>> trailerHitch[0];\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage HitchingSystemModel {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    enum def ConnectionStatus {\n        enum CONNECTED;\n        enum DISCONNECTED;\n    }\n\n    port def HitchPort;\n\n    part def TowBall {\n        port hitchPort: HitchPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Coupler {\n        port hitchPort: HitchPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Chassis {\n        part towBall: TowBall;\n    }\n\n    part def TrailerFrame {\n        part coupler: Coupler;\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        part chassis: Chassis;\n    }\n\n    part def Trailer {\n        part trailerFrame: TrailerFrame;\n    }\n\n    part def HitchingSystem {\n        part vehicle: Vehicle;\n        part trailer: Trailer;\n        attribute status: ConnectionStatus = ConnectionStatus::DISCONNECTED;\n        connect vehicle.chassis.towBall.hitchPort to trailer.trailerFrame.coupler.hitchPort;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
