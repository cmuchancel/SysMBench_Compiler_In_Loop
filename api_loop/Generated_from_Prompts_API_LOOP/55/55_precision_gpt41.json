  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassAggregation' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tprivate import NumericalFunctions::*;\n\tpart def MassedThing {\n\t\tattribute simpleMass :> ISQ::mass; \n\t\tattribute totalMass :> ISQ::mass default simpleMass;\n\t}\n\tpart compositeThing : MassedThing {\n\t\tpart subcomponents: MassedThing[*];\t\t\n\t\tattribute :>> totalMass default\n\t\t\tsimpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass); \n\t}\n\tpart filteredMassThing :> compositeThing {\n\t\tattribute minMass :> ISQ::mass;\t\t\n\t\tattribute :>> totalMass =\n\t\t\tsimpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass.?{in p:>ISQ::mass; p >= minMass});\n\t}\n\tpart def CarPart :> MassedThing {\t\t\t\n\t\tattribute serialNumber: String;\n\t}\n\tpart car: CarPart :> compositeThing {\t\n\t\tattribute vin :>> serialNumber;\n\t\tpart carParts: CarPart[*] :>> subcomponents;\n\t\tpart engine :> carParts {\n\t\t\t//...\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart transmission :> carParts {\n\t\t\t//...\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tprivate import SI::kg;\n\tpart c :> car {\n\t\tattribute :>> simpleMass = 1000[kg];\n\t\tpart :>> engine {\n\t\t\tattribute :>> simpleMass = 100[kg];\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart redefines transmission {\n\t\t\tattribute :>> simpleMass = 50[kg];\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\n\t// c::totalMass --> 1150.0[kg]\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleMassManagement {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  part def Component {\n    attribute serialNumber : String;\n    attribute ownMass : Real;\n    attribute massThreshold : Real;\n    attribute totalMass : Real;\n    part subcomponents : Component[*];\n  }\n\n  part def Engine specializes Component {\n  }\n\n  part def Transmission specializes Component {\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    attribute vin : String;\n    attribute ownMass : Real;\n    attribute massThreshold : Real;\n    attribute totalMass : Real;\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part transmission : Transmission;\n    part components : Component[*];\n  }\n\n  part vehicle : Vehicle;\n}\n\nOutput:",
