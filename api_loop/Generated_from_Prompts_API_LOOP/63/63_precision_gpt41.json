  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleMassBudgetingConstraints' {\n\tprivate import ISQ::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n\tprivate import NumericalFunctions::*;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def Transmission;\n\tconstraint def MassConstraint {\n\t\tin partMasses : MassValue[0..*];\n\t\tin massLimit : MassValue;\n\t}\n\tconstraint massConstraint : MassConstraint {\n\t\tin partMasses : MassValue[0..*];\n\t\tin massLimit : MassValue;\t\t\n\t\tsum(partMasses) <= massLimit\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tassert massConstraint {\n\t\t\tin partMasses = (chassisMass, engine.mass, transmission.mass);\n\t\t\tin massLimit = 2500[kg];\n\t\t}\t\n\t\tattribute chassisMass : MassValue;\n\t\tpart engine : Engine {\n\t\t\tattribute mass : MassValue;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart transmission : Engine {\n\t\t\tattribute mass : MassValue;\n\t\t}\n\t}\t\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleMassBudget {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    enum def MassUnit {\n        kg;\n    }\n\n    part def Chassis {\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute massUnit : MassUnit;\n    }\n\n    part def Engine {\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute massUnit : MassUnit;\n    }\n\n    part def Transmission {\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute massUnit : MassUnit;\n    }\n\n    part def OtherComponent {\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute massUnit : MassUnit;\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        attribute massLimit : Real = 2500;\n        part chassis : Chassis;\n        part engine : Engine;\n        part transmission : Transmission;\n        part other : OtherComponent;\n        attribute totalMass : Real = chassis.mass + engine.mass + transmission.mass + other.mass;\n        attribute withinLimit : Boolean = totalMass <= massLimit;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
