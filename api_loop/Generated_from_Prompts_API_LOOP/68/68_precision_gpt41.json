  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleSystemRequirementsSpecification' {\n\tprivate import ISQ::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n\trequirement def MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\tdoc /* The actual mass shall be less than or equal to the required mass. */\n\t\tattribute massActual: MassValue;\n\t\tattribute massReqd: MassValue;\n\t\trequire constraint { massActual <= massReqd }\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute dryMass: MassValue;\n\t\tattribute fuelMass: MassValue;\n\t\tattribute fuelFullMass: MassValue;\n\t}\n\trequirement def <'1'> VehicleMassLimitationRequirement :> MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\tdoc /* The total mass of a vehicle shall be less than or equal to the required mass. */\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tattribute redefines massActual = vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass;\n\t\tassume constraint { vehicle.fuelMass > 0[kg] }\n\t}\n\tport def ClutchPort;\n\taction def GenerateTorque;\n\trequirement def <'2'> DrivePowerInterface {\n\t\tdoc /* The engine shall transfer its generated torque to the transmission via the clutch interface. */\n\t\tsubject clutchPort: ClutchPort;\n\t}\n\trequirement def <'3'> TorqueGeneration {\n\t\tdoc /* The engine shall generate torque as a function of RPM as shown in Table 1. */\n\t\tsubject generateTorque: GenerateTorque;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleSystem {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  port def TorquePort {\n    attribute torque : Real;\n    attribute speed : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Engine {\n    port torqueOut : TorquePort;\n    attribute maxTorque : Real = 300;\n    attribute ratedSpeed : Real = 4000;\n  }\n\n  part def Clutch {\n    port engineSide : TorquePort;\n    port transSide : TorquePort;\n  }\n\n  part def Transmission {\n    port input : TorquePort;\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    attribute curbMass : Real = 1450;\n    attribute fuelMass : Real = 50;\n    attribute totalMass : Real = 1500;\n    attribute maxMassLimit : Real = 2000;\n\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part clutch : Clutch;\n    part transmission : Transmission;\n\n    connect engine.torqueOut to clutch.engineSide;\n    connect clutch.transSide to transmission.input;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
