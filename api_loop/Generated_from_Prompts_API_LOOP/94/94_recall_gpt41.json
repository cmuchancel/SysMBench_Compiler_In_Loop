  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'Automotive Domain Annotations' {\n\t/* This is a comment, which is a part of the model, \n\t * annotating (by default) it's owning namespace. */\n\tcomment Comment1 /* This is a named comment. */\n\tcomment about Automobile\n\t/* This is an unnamed comment, annotating an \n\t * explicitly specified element. \n\t */\n\tpart def Automobile;\n\talias Car for Automobile {\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * This is a comment annotating its owning\n\t\t * element.\n\t\t */\n\t}\t                         \n\t// This is a note.
