  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleSafetyandSecurityComponentRegistry' {\n\tpart vehicle1_c1 {\n\t\tpart interior {\n\t\t\tpart alarm;\n\t\t\tpart seatBelt[2];\n\t\t\tpart frontSeat[2];\n\t\t\tpart driverAirBag;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart bodyAssy {\n\t\t\tpart body;\n\t\t\tpart bumper;\n\t\t\tpart keylessEntry;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Safety Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle1_c1::interior::seatBelt;\n\t\tprivate import vehicle1_c1::interior::driverAirBag;\n\t\tprivate import vehicle1_c1::bodyAssy::bumper;\t\t\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Security Features' {\n\t\tprivate import vehicle1_c1::interior::alarm;\n\t\tprivate import vehicle1_c1::bodyAssy::keylessEntry;\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Safety & Security Features' {\n\t\tprivate import 'Safety Features'::*;\n\t\tprivate import 'Security Features'::*;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleSafetySecurityModel {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  part def AlarmSystem {\n    attribute securityFeature : Boolean = true;\n  }\n\n  part def SeatBelt {\n    attribute safetyFeature : Boolean = true;\n  }\n\n  part def FrontRowSeat {\n  }\n\n  part def DriverAirbag {\n    attribute safetyFeature : Boolean = true;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleBody {\n  }\n\n  part def Bumper {\n    attribute safetyFeature : Boolean = true;\n  }\n\n  part def KeylessEntrySystem {\n    attribute securityFeature : Boolean = true;\n  }\n\n  part def Interior {\n    part alarmSystem : AlarmSystem;\n    part seatBelts : SeatBelt;\n    part frontRowSeats : FrontRowSeat;\n    part driverAirbag : DriverAirbag;\n  }\n\n  part def BodyAssembly {\n    part vehicleBody : VehicleBody;\n    part bumper : Bumper;\n    part keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleSafetySecuritySystem {\n    part interior : Interior;\n    part bodyAssembly : BodyAssembly;\n    attribute safetyIntegrated : Boolean = true;\n    attribute securityIntegrated : Boolean = true;\n  }\n\n  part vehicleSystem : VehicleSafetySecuritySystem;\n}\n\nOutput:",
