  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleType' {\n\tabstract part def Vehicle;\n\tpart def HumanDrivenVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n\t\tref part driver : Person;\n\t}\n\tpart def PoweredVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t}\n\tpart def HumanDrivenPoweredVehicle :> \n\t\tHumanDrivenVehicle, PoweredVehicle;\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Person;\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage Vehicles {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    part def Personnel;\n    part def Engine;\n\n    part def Vehicle;\n\n    part def ManualVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n        part driver : Personnel[1];\n    }\n\n    part def PoweredVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n        part engine : Engine[1];\n    }\n\n    part def ManualPoweredVehicle specializes ManualVehicle, PoweredVehicle {\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
