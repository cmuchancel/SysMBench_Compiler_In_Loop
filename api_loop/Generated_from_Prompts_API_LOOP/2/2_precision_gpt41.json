  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleType' {\n\tabstract part def Vehicle;\n\tpart def HumanDrivenVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n\t\tref part driver : Person;\n\t}\n\tpart def PoweredVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t}\n\tpart def HumanDrivenPoweredVehicle :> \n\t\tHumanDrivenVehicle, PoweredVehicle;\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Person;\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage Vehicles {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    part def Personnel;\n    part def Engine;\n\n    part def Vehicle;\n\n    part def ManualVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n        part driver : Personnel[1];\n    }\n\n    part def PoweredVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n        part engine : Engine[1];\n    }\n\n    part def ManualPoweredVehicle specializes ManualVehicle, PoweredVehicle {\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
