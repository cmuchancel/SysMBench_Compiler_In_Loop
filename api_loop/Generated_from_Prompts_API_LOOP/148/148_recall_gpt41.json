List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'EngineeringMaterialsLibrary' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tprivate import Quantities::*;\n\tprivate import MeasurementReferences::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n    attribute def AtomicMassValue :> MassValue;\n\tattribute def TensileStrengthUnit :> DerivedUnit {\n        private attribute lengthPF: QuantityPowerFactor[1] { :>> quantity = isq.L; :>> exponent = -1; }\n        private attribute massPF: QuantityPowerFactor[1] { :>> quantity = isq.M; :>> exponent = 1; }\n        private attribute durationPF: QuantityPowerFactor[1] { :>> quantity = isq.T; :>> exponent = -2; }\n        attribute :>> quantityDimension { :>> quantityPowerFactors = (lengthPF, massPF, durationPF); }\t\t\n\t}\n    attribute def TensileStrengthValue :> ScalarQuantityValue {\n\t\tattribute :>> num: Real;\n    \tattribute :>> mRef: TensileStrengthUnit;\n    }\n    attribute <'N/mm²'> 'newton per square millimetre' : TensileStrengthUnit = N / mm^2;\n    attribute def Substance;\n\tattribute def Material :> Substance;\n    attribute def Metal :> Material {\n        attribute atomicMass: AtomicMassValue[1];\n    }\n    attribute def Alloy :> Material {\n        attribute fractions: MaterialFraction[2..*];\n    }\n    attribute def MaterialFraction {\n        attribute material: Material[1]; \n        attribute massFraction: MassFractionValue[1];\n    }\n    attribute def MassFractionValue :> DimensionOneValue;    \n    attribute Iron: Metal { :>> atomicMass = 55.845[Da]; }\n    attribute Carbon: Metal { :>> atomicMass = 12.011[Da]; }\n    attribute Manganese: Metal { :>> atomicMass = 54.938[Da]; }\n    attribute Steel_980: Alloy {\n        private attribute fraction1: MaterialFraction { :>> material = Iron; :>> massFraction = 0.9862[one]; }\n        private attribute fraction2: MaterialFraction { :>> material = Carbon; :>> massFraction = 0.0018[one]; }\n        private attribute fraction3: MaterialFraction { :>> material = Manganese; :>> massFraction = 0.012[one]; }\n    \tattribute :>> fractions = (fraction1, fraction2, fraction3);\n        attribute tensileStrength: TensileStrengthValue = 980 ['N/mm²'];\n    } \n}\n\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage MaterialsDB {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def MaterialType { metal; alloy; }\n\n  part def Material {\n    attribute name : String;\n    attribute materialType : MaterialType;\n    attribute atomicMass : Real;\n    attribute tensileStrength_N_per_mm2 : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def ConstituentFraction {\n    attribute constituentName : String;\n    attribute massFraction : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def MetalAlloy {\n    attribute name : String;\n    attribute materialType : MaterialType;\n    attribute atomicMass : Real;\n    attribute tensileStrength_N_per_mm2 : Real;\n    part constituents[*] : ConstituentFraction;\n    attribute compositionalInfo : String;\n  }\n\n  part Steel_980 : MetalAlloy {\n    attribute name = \"Steel_980\";\n    attribute materialType = MaterialType::alloy;\n    attribute atomicMass = 55.9;\n    attribute tensileStrength_N_per_mm2 = 980.0;\n    attribute compositionalInfo = \"High-strength steel alloy\";\n    part Fe : ConstituentFraction {\n      attribute constituentName = \"Iron\";\n      attribute massFraction = 0.985;\n    }\n    part C : ConstituentFraction {\n      attribute constituentName = \"Carbon\";\n      attribute massFraction = 0.010;\n    }\n    part Mn : ConstituentFraction {\n      attribute constituentName = \"Manganese\";\n      attribute massFraction = 0.005;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
