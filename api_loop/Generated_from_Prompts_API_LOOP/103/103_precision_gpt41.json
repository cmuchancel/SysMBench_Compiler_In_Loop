  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3.

Generated model uses containment. **Not supported** (structurally different).\n28. **Part `c2` in `B21`:** In reference, `ref c2: C2 = a11.b11.c2;` (reference, not containment). Generated model uses containment. **Not supported**.\n29. **Port `p21` in `B21`:** In reference, port is `:>> pg = c1.pa;` (binding, not a new port). Generated model uses a new port. **Not supported**.\n30. **Connection `c1.pb` to `c2.pc` in `B21`:** Present → **Supported**\n31. **Connection `p21` to `c1.pb` in `B21`:** In reference, port binding `:>> pg = c1.pa;` (not a connection). Generated model uses a connection. **Not supported**.\n\n##### B22\n32. **Part type `B22`:** Present → **Supported**\n33. **Part `c3` in `B22`:** In reference, `ref c3: C3 = a11.b12.c3;` (reference, not containment). Generated model uses containment. **Not supported**.\n34. **Part `c4` in `B22`:** In reference, `ref c4: C4 = a11.b12.c4;` (reference, not containment). Generated model uses containment. **Not supported**.\n35. **Port `p22` in `B22`:** In reference, port is `:>> ph = c2.pc;` (binding, not a new port). Generated model uses a new port. **Not supported**.\n36. **Connection `p22` to `c3.pd` in `B22`:** In reference, port binding `:>> ph = c2.pc;` (not a connection). Generated model uses a connection. **Not supported**.\n\n##### A21\n37. **Part type `A21`:** Present as `a12: A1` in reference, but the generated model makes it a part definition. The structure matches. → **Supported**\n38. **Part `b21` in `A21`:** Present → **Supported**\n39. **Part `b22` in `A21`:** Present → **Supported**\n40. **Connection `b21.p21` to `b22.p22` in `A21`:** In reference, connection is `connect b21.pg to b22.ph;` Generated model uses different port names (`p21` and `p22` instead of `pg` and `ph`). If we ignore naming, the structure matches. **Supported**\n\n##### System\n41. **Part type `System`:** Not present in reference model, but is just a container for `a11` and `a21`. Not present in reference, but doesn't contradict structure. **Not supported**.\n42. **Part `a11` in `System`:** Not present in reference model, but matches the top-level structure. **Not supported**.\n43. **Part `a21` in `System`:** Not present in reference model, but matches the top-level structure. **Not supported**.\n\n##### Top-level Instance\n44. **Part `system` (type: `System`):** Not present in reference model. **Not supported**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
