List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\nprivate import Views::*; \npackage 'VehicleSafetyandSecurityFeatureManagement' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpackage AnnotationDefinitions {\t\n\t\tmetadata def Safety {\n\t\t\tattribute isMandatory : Boolean;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetadata def Security;\n\t}\n\tpackage PartsTree {\n\t\tpublic import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\t\tpart vehicle {\n\t\t\tpart interior {\n\t\t\t\tpart alarm {@Security;}\n\t\t\t\tpart seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\t\tpart frontSeat[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart driverAirBag {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart bodyAssy {\n\t\t\t\tpart body;\n\t\t\t\tpart bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}\n\t\t\t\tpart keylessEntry {@Security;}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart wheelAssy {\n\t\t\t\tpart wheel[2];\n\t\t\t\tpart antilockBrakes[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpackage ViewDefinitions {\t\n\t\tpublic import AnnotationDefinitions::*;\n\t\tview def SafetyFeatureView {\n\t\t\t/* Parts that contribute to safety. */\t\t\n\t\t\tfilter @Safety;\n\t\t\trender asTreeDiagram;\n\t\t}\n\t\tview def SafetyOrSecurityFeatureView {\n\t\t\t/* Parts that contribute to safety OR security. */\t\t \n\t\t\tfilter @Safety | @Security;\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\n\tpackage Views {\n\t\tprivate import ViewDefinitions::*;\n\t\tprivate import PartsTree::vehicle;\n\t\tview vehicleSafetyFeatureView : SafetyFeatureView {\n\t\t\texpose vehicle::**;\n\t\t}\n\t\tview vehicleMandatorySafetyFeatureView :> vehicleSafetyFeatureView {\n\t\t\tfilter Safety::isMandatory;\n\t\t}\n\t\tview vehicleMandatorySafetyFeatureViewStandalone {\n\t\t\texpose vehicle::**[@Safety and Safety::isMandatory];\n\t\t\trender asElementTable;\n\t\t}\t\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleSafetySecurityModel {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def FeatureType { safety; security; }\n  enum def SafetyLevel { mandatory; optional; notApplicable; }\n  enum def ViewType { tree; table; }\n\n  part def VehicleComponent {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel;\n  }\n\n  part def SeatBelt {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType = FeatureType::safety;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel = SafetyLevel::mandatory;\n  }\n\n  part def Bumper {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType = FeatureType::safety;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel = SafetyLevel::mandatory;\n  }\n\n  part def Airbag {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType = FeatureType::safety;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel = SafetyLevel::optional;\n  }\n\n  part def AntiLockBrakingSystem {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType = FeatureType::safety;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel = SafetyLevel::optional;\n  }\n\n  part def AlarmDevice {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType = FeatureType::security;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel = SafetyLevel::notApplicable;\n  }\n\n  part def KeylessEntrySystem {\n    attribute featureType : FeatureType = FeatureType::security;\n    attribute safetyLevel : SafetyLevel = SafetyLevel::notApplicable;\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    part seatBelt : SeatBelt;\n    part bumper : Bumper;\n    part airbag : Airbag;\n    part abs : AntiLockBrakingSystem;\n    part alarm : AlarmDevice;\n    part keylessEntry : KeylessEntrySystem;\n  }\n\n  part def Filter {\n    attribute filterType : FeatureType;\n  }\n\n  part def SafetyFilter {\n    attribute filterType : FeatureType = FeatureType::safety;\n  }\n\n  part def SecurityFilter {\n    attribute filterType : FeatureType = FeatureType::security;\n  }\n\n  part def Visualization {\n    attribute viewType : ViewType;\n  }\n\n  part def TreeView {\n    attribute viewType : ViewType = ViewType::tree;\n  }\n\n  part def TableView {\n    attribute viewType : ViewType = ViewType::table;\n  }\n\n  part def SafetySecurityManagementSystem {\n    part vehicle : Vehicle;\n    part safetyFilter : SafetyFilter;\n    part securityFilter : SecurityFilter;\n    part treeView : TreeView;\n    part tableView : TableView;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
