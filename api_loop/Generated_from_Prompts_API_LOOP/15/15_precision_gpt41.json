  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleFuelSystem' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tattribute def Temp;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelOutPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tport def FuelInPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tin item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tout item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTankAssembly {\n\t\tport fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport engineFuelPort : FuelInPort;\n\t}\n\tpart vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\tpart tankAssy : FuelTankAssembly;\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t\tflow of Fuel\n\t\t  from tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelSupply\n\t\t\tto eng.engineFuelPort.fuelSupply;\n\t\tflow of Fuel\n\t\t  from eng.engineFuelPort.fuelReturn\n\t\t\tto tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelReturn;\n\t} \n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage FuelSystemModel {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  item def Fuel;\n\n  item def TemperatureInfo {\n    attribute value : Real;\n  }\n\n  port def FuelPort {\n    ref item fuel : Fuel;\n  }\n\n  port def TemperaturePort {\n    ref item temp : TemperatureInfo;\n  }\n\n  part def FuelTankAssembly {\n    port supply : FuelPort;\n    port returnPort : FuelPort;\n    port tempOut : TemperaturePort;\n  }\n\n  part def Engine {\n    port fuelIn : FuelPort;\n    port fuelReturn : FuelPort;\n    port tempOut : TemperaturePort;\n  }\n\n  part def TemperatureMonitor {\n    port tempIn1 : TemperaturePort;\n    port tempIn2 : TemperaturePort;\n    port tempOut : TemperaturePort;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleFuelSystem {\n    part tank : FuelTankAssembly;\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part monitor : TemperatureMonitor;\n    port systemTempOut : TemperaturePort;\n\n    connect tank.supply to engine.fuelIn;\n    connect engine.fuelReturn to tank.returnPort;\n    connect tank.tempOut to monitor.tempIn1;\n    connect engine.tempOut to monitor.tempIn2;\n    connect monitor.tempOut to systemTempOut;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
