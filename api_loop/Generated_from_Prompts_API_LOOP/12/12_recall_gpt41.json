  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'WaterDelivery' {\n\tport def SpigotBank;\n\tport def Spigot;\n\tport def Faucet;\n\tport def FaucetInlet;\n\tinterface def WaterDelivery {\n\t\tend suppliedBy : SpigotBank[1] {\n\t\t\tport hot : Spigot;\n\t\t\tport cold : Spigot;\n\t\t}\n\t\tend deliveredTo : Faucet[1..*] {\n\t\t\tport hot : FaucetInlet;\n\t\t\tport cold : FaucetInlet;\n\t\t}\n\t\tconnect suppliedBy.hot to deliveredTo.hot;\n\t\tconnect suppliedBy.cold to deliveredTo.cold;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage WaterSupplyModel {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    item def HotWater;\n    item def ColdWater;\n\n    port def HotPort { }\n    port def ColdPort { }\n\n    part def SpigotBank {\n        port hotOut: HotPort;\n        port coldOut: ColdPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Spigot {\n        port hotIn: HotPort;\n        port coldIn: ColdPort;\n        port hotOut: HotPort;\n        port coldOut: ColdPort;\n        connect hotIn to hotOut;\n        connect coldIn to coldOut;\n    }\n\n    part def FaucetInlet {\n        port hotIn: HotPort;\n        port coldIn: ColdPort;\n    }\n\n    part def Faucet {\n        part inlet: FaucetInlet;\n    }\n\n    part def WaterSupplySystem {\n        part bank: SpigotBank;\n        part spigot1: Spigot;\n        part spigot2: Spigot;\n        part faucet1: Faucet;\n        part faucet2: Faucet;\n\n        connect bank.hotOut to spigot1.hotIn;\n        connect bank.coldOut to spigot1.coldIn;\n        connect bank.hotOut to spigot2.hotIn;\n        connect bank.coldOut to spigot2.coldIn;\n\n        connect spigot1.hotOut to faucet1.inlet.hotIn;\n        connect spigot1.coldOut to faucet1.inlet.coldIn;\n\n        connect spigot2.hotOut to faucet2.inlet.hotIn;\n        connect spigot2.coldOut to faucet2.inlet.coldIn;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
