  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehiclePowertrainConfig' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def Engine;\n\tpart def '4CylEngine' :> Engine;\n\tpart def '6CylEngine' :> Engine;\n\tpart def Transmission;\n\tpart def ManualTransmission :> Transmission;\n\tpart def AutomaticTransmission :> Transmission;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute isHighPerformance: Boolean;\n\t\tpart engine: Engine[1];\n\t\tpart transmission: Transmission[1];\n\t\tassert constraint {\n\t\t\tif isHighPerformance? engine istype '6CylEngine'\n\t\t\telse engine istype '4CylEngine'\n\t\t}\n\t\tassert constraint {\n\t\t\t(engine istype '4CylEngine' and \n\t\t\t transmission istype ManualTransmission) xor\n\t\t\t(engine istype '6CylEngine' and\n\t\t\t transmission istype AutomaticTransmission)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage PowertrainConfiguration {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def EngineType {\n    enum FourCylinder;\n    enum SixCylinder;\n  }\n\n  enum def TransmissionType {\n    enum Manual;\n    enum Automatic;\n  }\n\n  part def Engine {\n    attribute engineType : EngineType;\n  }\n\n  part def FourCylinderEngine {\n    attribute engineType : EngineType = EngineType::FourCylinder;\n  }\n\n  part def SixCylinderEngine {\n    attribute engineType : EngineType = EngineType::SixCylinder;\n  }\n\n  part def Transmission {\n    attribute transmissionType : TransmissionType;\n  }\n\n  part def ManualTransmission {\n    attribute transmissionType : TransmissionType = TransmissionType::Manual;\n  }\n\n  part def AutomaticTransmission {\n    attribute transmissionType : TransmissionType = TransmissionType::Automatic;\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    attribute highPerformance : Boolean;\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part transmission : Transmission;\n  }\n\n  part def FourCylinderManualVehicle {\n    attribute highPerformance : Boolean = false;\n    part engine : FourCylinderEngine;\n    part transmission : ManualTransmission;\n  }\n\n  part def SixCylinderAutomaticVehicle {\n    attribute highPerformance : Boolean = true;\n    part engine : SixCylinderEngine;\n    part transmission : AutomaticTransmission;\n  }\n\n  part standardVehicle : FourCylinderManualVehicle;\n  part highPerformanceVehicle : SixCylinderAutomaticVehicle;\n}\n\nOutput:",
