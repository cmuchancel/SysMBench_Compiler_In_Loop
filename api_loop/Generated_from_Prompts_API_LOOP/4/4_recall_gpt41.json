List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleDefinition' {\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t}\n\tpart def SmallVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart smallEng : SmallEngine redefines eng;\n\t}\n\tpart def BigVehicle :> Vehicle {\n\t\tpart bigEng : BigEngine :>> eng;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tpart cyl : Cylinder[4..6];\n\t}\n\tpart def SmallEngine :> Engine {\n\t\tpart redefines cyl[4];\n\t}\n\tpart def BigEngine :> Engine {\n\t\tpart redefines cyl[6];\n\t}\n\tpart def Cylinder;\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleSystem {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    part def Cylinder;\n\n    part def Engine {\n        part cylinders : Cylinder;\n        attribute cylinderCount : Integer;\n    }\n\n    part def SmallEngine specializes Engine {\n        attribute cylinderCount : Integer = 4;\n    }\n\n    part def LargeEngine specializes Engine {\n        attribute cylinderCount : Integer = 6;\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        part engine : Engine;\n    }\n\n    part def SmallVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n        part engine : SmallEngine;\n    }\n\n    part def LargeVehicle specializes Vehicle {\n        part engine : LargeEngine;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
