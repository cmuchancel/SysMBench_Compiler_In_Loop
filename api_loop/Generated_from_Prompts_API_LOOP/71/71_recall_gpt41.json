  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleRequirementsSpecialization' {\n\tprivate import ISQ::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n\trequirement def MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\tdoc /* The actual mass shall be less than or equal to the required mass. */\n\t\tattribute massActual: MassValue;\n\t\tattribute massReqd: MassValue;\n\t\trequire constraint { massActual <= massReqd }\n\t}\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute dryMass: MassValue;\n\t\tattribute fuelMass: MassValue;\n\t\tattribute fuelFullMass: MassValue;\n\t}\n\trequirement def <'1'> VehicleMassLimitationRequirement :> MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\tdoc /* The total mass of a vehicle shall be less than or equal to the required mass. */\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tattribute redefines massActual = vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass;\n\t\tassume constraint { vehicle.fuelMass > 0[kg] }\n\t}\n\tport def ClutchPort;\n\taction def GenerateTorque;\n\trequirement def <'2'> DrivePowerInterface {\n\t\tdoc /* The engine shall transfer its generated torque to the transmission via the clutch interface. */\n\t\tsubject clutchPort: ClutchPort;\n\t}\t\n\trequirement def <'3'> TorqueGeneration {\n\t\tdoc /* The engine shall generate torque as a function of RPM as shown in Table 1. */\n\t\tsubject generateTorque: GenerateTorque;\n\t}\n\trequirement <'1.1'> fullVehicleMassLimit : VehicleMassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tattribute :>> massReqd = 2000[kg];\n\t\tassume constraint {\n\t\t\tdoc /* Full tank is full. */\n\t\t\tvehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\trequirement <'1.2'> emptyVehicleMassLimit : VehicleMassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tattribute :>> massReqd = 1500[kg];\t\n\t\tassume constraint {\n\t\t\tdoc /* Full tank is empty. */\n\t\t\tvehicle.fuelMass == 0[kg]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleSystem {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    port def TorquePort {\n        attribute torque : Real;\n        attribute speed : Real;\n    }\n\n    part def Engine {\n        attribute maxTorque : Real = 350;\n        attribute speed1 : Real = 2000;\n        attribute torqueAtSpeed1 : Real = 300;\n        attribute speed2 : Real = 4000;\n        attribute torqueAtSpeed2 : Real = 280;\n        port outTorque : TorquePort;\n    }\n\n    part def Clutch {\n        port inTorque : TorquePort;\n        port outTorque : TorquePort;\n    }\n\n    part def Gearbox {\n        port inTorque : TorquePort;\n    }\n\n    part def FullFuelMass {\n        attribute curbMass : Real = 1400;\n        attribute fuelMass : Real = 500;\n        attribute totalMass : Real = 1900;\n    }\n\n    part def EmptyFuelMass {\n        attribute curbMass : Real = 1400;\n        attribute fuelMass : Real = 0;\n        attribute totalMass : Real = 1400;\n    }\n\n    part def Vehicle {\n        part engine : Engine;\n        part clutch : Clutch;\n        part gearbox : Gearbox;\n\n        part fullFuel : FullFuelMass;\n        part emptyFuel : EmptyFuelMass;\n\n        connect engine.outTorque to clutch.inTorque;\n        connect clutch.outTorque to gearbox.inTorque;\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:",
