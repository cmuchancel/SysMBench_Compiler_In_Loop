  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'TransportationScenario' {\n\tpart def Vehicle;\n\tpart def Person;\n\tpart def Environment;\n\tpart def 'Fuel Station';\n\tuse case def 'Provide Transportation' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t\tactor environment : Environment;\n\t\tobjective {\n\t\t\tdoc \n\t\t\t/* Transport driver and passengers from starting location \n\t\t\t * to ending location.\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t}\t\t\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Enter Vehicle' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t}\n\tuse case def 'Exit Vehicle' {\n\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\tactor driver : Person;\n\t\tactor passengers : Person[0..4];\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage TransportationSystem {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def DoorState { \n    enum Closed;\n    enum Open;\n  }\n\n  port def DoorPort;\n  port def VehiclePort;\n\n  part def Person {\n    attribute name : String;\n  }\n\n  part def Driver {\n    attribute name : String;\n    attribute licensed : Boolean;\n  }\n\n  part def Passenger {\n    attribute name : String;\n  }\n\n  part def Seat {\n    attribute occupied : Boolean;\n    attribute comfortLevel : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Door {\n    port doorPort : DoorPort;\n    attribute doorState : DoorState;\n  }\n\n  part def Environment {\n    attribute weatherSafe : Boolean;\n    attribute sustainabilityConsidered : Boolean;\n  }\n\n  part def Infrastructure {\n    attribute gasStationCompatible : Boolean;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleSystem {\n    attribute capacity : Integer = 5;\n    attribute passengerCapacity : Integer = 4;\n    attribute safetyEnabled : Boolean;\n    attribute comfortEnabled : Boolean;\n    attribute easyEntryExit : Boolean;\n    attribute humanCentered : Boolean;\n    attribute supportsTrip : Boolean;\n\n    port vehiclePort : VehiclePort;\n\n    part driver : Driver;\n    part passenger1 : Passenger;\n    part passenger2 : Passenger;\n    part passenger3 : Passenger;\n    part passenger4 : Passenger;\n\n    part driverSeat : Seat;\n    part seat1 : Seat;\n    part seat2 : Seat;\n    part seat3 : Seat;\n    part seat4 : Seat;\n\n    part door1 : Door;\n    part door2 : Door;\n    part door3 : Door;\n    part door4 : Door;\n\n    part environment : Environment;\n    part infrastructure : Infrastructure;\n\n    connect door1.doorPort to vehiclePort;\n    connect door2.doorPort to vehiclePort;\n    connect door3.doorPort to vehiclePort;\n    connect door4.doorPort to vehiclePort;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
