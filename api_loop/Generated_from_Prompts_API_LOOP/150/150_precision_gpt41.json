  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the precision of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model (i.e., the reference model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of supported claims>/<total number of claims in the generated model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'PubSubMessagingFlow' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tprivate import PayloadDefinitions::*;\n\tpackage PayloadDefinitions {\n\t    item def Subscribe {\n\t    \tattribute topic : String;\n\t    \tref part subscriber;\n\t    }\n\t\titem def Publish {\n\t\t\tattribute topic : String;\n\t\t\tref publication;\n\t\t}\n\t\titem def Deliver {\n\t\t\tref publication;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\toccurrence def PubSubSequence {\n\t\tpart producer[1] {\n\t\t\tevent publish_message.source;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmessage publish_message of Publish[1];\n\t\tpart server[1] {\n\t\t\tevent subscribe_message.target;\n\t\t\tthen event publish_message.target;\n\t\t\tthen event deliver_message.source;\n\t\t}\n\t\tmessage subscribe_message of Subscribe[1];\n\t\tmessage deliver_message of Deliver[1];\n\t\tpart consumer[1] {\n\t\t\tevent subscribe_message.source;\n\t\t\tthen event deliver_message.target;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage PubSubModel {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n  enum def TopicEnum {\n    enum TopicA;\n    enum TopicB;\n    enum TopicC;\n  }\n  item def Message {\n    attribute topic : TopicEnum;\n    attribute payload : String;\n  }\n  item def Subscription {\n    attribute topic : TopicEnum;\n    attribute consumerId : String;\n  }\n  port def PublishPort {\n  }\n  port def SubscribePort {\n  }\n  port def DeliverPort {\n  }\n  part def Producer {\n    port publish : PublishPort;\n  }\n  part def Consumer {\n    port subscribe : SubscribePort;\n    port receive : DeliverPort;\n  }\n  part def Server {\n    port fromProducers : PublishPort;\n    port fromConsumers : SubscribePort;\n    port toConsumers : DeliverPort;\n  }\n  part PubSubSystem {\n    part producer : Producer;\n    part consumer : Consumer;\n    part server : Server;\n    connect producer.publish to server.fromProducers;\n    connect consumer.subscribe to server.fromConsumers;\n    connect server.toConsumers to consumer.receive;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
