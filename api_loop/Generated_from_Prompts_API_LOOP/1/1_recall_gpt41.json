  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'VehicleDefinition' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::*;\n\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\tattribute mass : Real;\n\t\tattribute status : VehicleStatus;\n\t\tpart eng : Engine;\n\t\tref part driver : Person;\n\t}\n\tattribute def VehicleStatus {\n\t\tattribute gearSetting : Integer;\n\t\tattribute acceleratorPosition : Real;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine;\t\n\tpart def Person;\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage VehicleSystem {\n  private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n  enum def GearSetting {\n    enum Park;\n    enum Reverse;\n    enum Neutral;\n    enum Drive;\n    enum Low;\n  }\n\n  part def VehicleStatus {\n    attribute gearSetting : GearSetting;\n    attribute acceleratorPedalPosition : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Engine {\n    attribute engineId : String;\n    attribute engineType : String;\n    attribute ratedPower : Real;\n  }\n\n  part def Driver {\n    attribute driverId : String;\n    attribute name : String;\n    attribute licenseNumber : String;\n  }\n\n  part def Vehicle {\n    attribute vehicleId : String;\n    attribute mass : Real;\n    part status : VehicleStatus;\n    part engine : Engine;\n    part driver : Driver;\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:",
