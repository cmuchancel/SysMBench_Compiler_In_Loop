  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'FuelFlowManagement' {\n\tattribute def Temp;\n\tpart def Fuel;\n\tport def FuelOutPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tout item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tin item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tport def FuelInPort {\n\t\tattribute temperature : Temp;\n\t\tin item fuelSupply : Fuel;\n\t\tout item fuelReturn : Fuel;\n\t}\n\tpart def FuelTankAssembly {\n\t\tport fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort;\n\t}\n\tpart def Engine {\n\t\tport engineFuelPort : FuelInPort;\n\t}\n}\n\nGenerated Model:\npackage FuelManagement {\n   private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n   item def FuelFlow {\n      attribute rate : Real;\n   }\n\n   item def TemperatureInfo {\n      attribute temperature : Real;\n   }\n\n   item def FlowStatus {\n      attribute supplyRate : Real;\n      attribute returnRate : Real;\n      attribute temperature : Real;\n   }\n\n   port def FuelSupplyPort {\n   }\n\n   port def FuelReturnPort {\n   }\n\n   port def TemperaturePort {\n   }\n\n   port def StatusPort {\n   }\n\n   part def FuelTankAssembly {\n      port supplyOut : FuelSupplyPort;\n      port returnIn : FuelReturnPort;\n      port temperature : TemperaturePort;\n      port statusOut : StatusPort;\n      attribute currentSupplyRate : Real;\n      attribute currentReturnRate : Real;\n      attribute currentTemperature : Real;\n      attribute currentStatus : FlowStatus;\n   }\n\n   part def Engine {\n      port fuelIn : FuelSupplyPort;\n      port returnOut : FuelReturnPort;\n      port temperature : TemperaturePort;\n      attribute requiredSupplyRate : Real;\n      attribute excessReturnRate : Real;\n      attribute engineTemperature : Real;\n   }\n\n   part def FuelManagementSystem {\n      part tank : FuelTankAssembly;\n      part engine : Engine;\n      port statusOut : StatusPort;\n\n      connect tank.supplyOut to engine.fuelIn;\n      connect engine.returnOut to tank.returnIn;\n      connect tank.temperature to engine.temperature;\n      connect tank.statusOut to statusOut;\n   }\n}\n\nOutput:",
