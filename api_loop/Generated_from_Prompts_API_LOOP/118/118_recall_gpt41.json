  "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the **recall** of a generated system model. You will be given a reference system model and a generated system model. Please perform the following steps:\n\n1. List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model. Each atomic claim should correspond to a minimal, meaningful modeling element (e.g., the definition of a part, the declaration of an attribute, the use of types, or structural relations like containment or reference).\n2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element).\n3. Summarize the results using the format: Score: <number of covered claims>/<total number of claims in the reference model>\n\nYou should IGNORE formatting or identifier NAMING differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\nInput:\nReference Model:\npackage 'AutomotiveSpecificationSystem' {\n\tprivate import ScalarValues::Real;\n\tprivate import ISQ::*;\n\tprivate import SI::*;\n\tpublic import 'Vehicle Usages'::*;\n\tpublic import 'Vehicle Requirements'::*;\n\tpackage 'Vehicle Definitions' {\n\t\tpart def Vehicle {\n\t\t\tattribute mass: MassValue;\n\t\t\tattribute fuelLevel: Real;\n\t\t\tattribute fuelTankCapacity: Real;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart def Engine {\n\t\t\tport drivePwrPort: DrivePwrPort;\n\t\t\tperform action 'generate torque': 'Generate Torque';\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart def Transmission {\n\t\t\tport clutchPort: ClutchPort;\n\t\t}\n\t\tport def DrivePwrPort;\n\t\tport def ClutchPort;\n\t\tinterface def EngineToTransmissionInterface {\n\t\t\tend drivePwrPort: DrivePwrPort;\n\t\t\tend clutchPort: ClutchPort;\n\t\t}\n\t\taction def 'Generate Torque';\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Vehicle Usages' {\n\t\tpublic import 'Vehicle Definitions'::*;\n\t\taction 'provide power' {\n\t\t\taction 'generate torque' { /* ... */ }\n\t\t\t//...\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart vehicle1_c1: Vehicle {\n\t\t\tattribute :>> mass = 2000 [kg];\n\t\t\tperform 'provide power';\t\n\t\t\tpart engine_v1: Engine {\n\t\t\t\tport :>> drivePwrPort;\n\t\t\t\tperform 'provide power'.'generate torque' :>> 'generate torque';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpart transmission: Transmission {\n\t\t\t\tport :>> clutchPort;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tinterface engineToTransmission: EngineToTransmissionInterface\n\t\t\t\tconnect engine_v1.drivePwrPort to transmission.clutchPort;\n\t\t}\n\t\tpart vehicle1_c2: Vehicle {\n\t\t\tattribute :>> mass = 2500 [kg];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpackage 'Vehicle Requirements' {\t\n\t\tpublic import 'Vehicle Definitions'::*;\n\t\trequirement def <'1'> MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\t\tattribute massActual: MassValue;\n\t\t\tattribute massReqd: MassValue;\n\t\t\trequire constraint {\n\t\t\t\t massActual <= massReqd \n\t\t\t }\n\t\t}\n\t\trequirement def <'2'> ReliabilityRequirement;\n\t\trequirement <'1.1'> vehicleMass1: MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle {\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tattribute :>> massActual: MassValue = vehicle.mass {\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tattribute :>> massReqd = 2000 [kg] {\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tassume constraint fuelConstraint {\n\t\t\t\tvehicle.fuelLevel >= vehicle.fuelTankCapacity\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\trequirement <'2.1'> vehicleMass2: MassLimitationRequirement {\n\t\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\t\tattribute :>> massActual: MassValue = vehicle.mass;\n\t\t\tattribute :>> massReqd = 2500 [kg];\n\t\t\tassume constraint fuelConstraint {\n\t\t\t\tvehicle.fuelLevel == 0.0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\trequirement <'2.2'> vehicleReliability2: ReliabilityRequirement {\n\t\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\t}\n\t\trequirement <'3.1'> drivePowerInterface {\n\t\t\tsubject drivePwrPort: DrivePwrPort;\n\t\t}\n\t\trequirement <'3.2'> torqueGeneration {\n\t\t\tsubject generateTorque: 'Generate Torque';\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tpart 'vehicle1_c1 Specification Context' {\n\t\tprivate import 'vehicle1-c1 Specification'::*;\n\t\tprivate import 'engine-v1 Specification'::*;\n\t\trequirement 'vehicle1-c1 Specification' {\t\t\n\t\t\tsubject vehicle : Vehicle;\n\t\t\trequirement references vehicleMass1 {\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\trequirement 'engine-v1 Specification' {\n\t\t\tsubject engine : Engine;\n\t\t\trequire torqueGeneration {\n\t\t\t\tin :>> generateTorque = engine.'generate torque';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\trequire drivePowerInterface {\n\t\t\t\tin :>> drivePwrPort = engine.drivePwrPort;
