Pretend MBSE Requirements — Portable Variable Soft-Toss Training Machine
Solution-agnostic requirements and constraints intended to drive MBSE functional decomposition and concept exploration

The system shall deliver a regulation softball (or equivalent practice ball) from a machine output location toward a batter’s hitting area.
R-FUNC-002 (Varied toss parameters)
The system shall be capable of varying toss
height
,
speed
, and
direction/angle
across successive tosses.
R-FUNC-003 (Toss location variability)
The system shall be capable of delivering tosses to different locations within a user-defined target region appropriate for batting drills.
R-FUNC-004 (Timing control)
The system shall provide a user-defined toss interval (time between tosses), including the ability to adjust the interval during practice.
R-FUNC-005 (Consistency mode)
The system shall support a repeatable mode where, for a given configuration, toss outcomes remain consistent within a defined tolerance for training drills.
R-FUNC-006 (Misfire prevention)
The system shall prevent or detect common feed/launch faults (e.g., no-toss events, weak tosses, or multiple balls entering the launch path at once) and shall respond in a safe, predictable manner.
3) Performance requirements (measurable targets)
R-PERF-001 (Targeting capability)
The system shall be able to intentionally direct tosses to selected portions of a defined strike-zone-like region after a calibration/setup procedure.
R-PERF-002 (Repeatability under controlled feed)
When operated with a consistent ball feed condition, the system shall achieve shot-to-shot landing-location repeatability within a small tolerance band suitable for batting drills.
R-PERF-003 (Useful operating distance)
The system shall support an operating distance range suitable for soft-toss drills while maintaining practical accuracy in that range.
R-PERF-004 (Cycle rate)
The system shall support repeated toss cycles over a full practice session without performance degradation that prevents normal use.
4) Key constraints
R-CNST-001 (Portability)
The system shall be portable and lightweight enough for a single person to transport and set up for practice.
R-CNST-002 (Environmental robustness)
The system shall tolerate dust/dirt exposure and outdoor weather variability typical of practice environments.
R-CNST-003 (Protective enclosure)
The system shall include protective measures to shield internal components from field conditions and weather exposure.
R-CNST-004 (Cost target)
The system shall be designed to achieve a target end-user price range of
$150–$300
.
R-CNST-005 (Manufacturability)
The system shall be compatible with a simple, low-cost manufacturing approach suitable for repeat production.
R-CNST-006 (Service life)
The system shall be designed for a long service life under repeated use and typical handling/transport conditions.
5) Interfaces and usability requirements
R-INT-001 (User controls)
The system shall provide user controls for: (a) enabling/disabling operation, (b) setting toss timing, and (c) selecting or enabling variation of toss outcomes.
R-INT-002 (Ease of use)
The system shall be easy to set up and operate by a coach or player with minimal training.
R-INT-003 (User feedback)
The system shall provide basic operational feedback (e.g., ready, active, fault/stop) that is understandable in a practice environment.
R-INT-004 (Power source)
The system shall support a reliable power source appropriate for field and indoor use and shall protect users from electrical hazards.
R-INT-005 (Transport and storage)
The system shall support convenient transport and storage (e.g., compact form, manageable handling features) without requiring disassembly beyond normal stow steps.
6) Safety and assurance requirements
R-SAFE-001 (Emergency stop)
The system shall provide an emergency stop function that immediately transitions the system to a safe state.
R-SAFE-002 (Guarding)
The system shall prevent user contact with hazardous moving elements during normal operation and typical setup/maintenance actions.
R-SAFE-003 (Safe fault response)
In the presence of detected faults (e.g., jam, abnormal operation, control error), the system shall enter a safe state that prevents unintended ball launch or unsafe motion.
R-SAFE-004 (Impact resistance)
The system shall tolerate incidental impacts expected in a practice environment (e.g., stray ball contact) without creating unsafe conditions.
7) Reliability, maintainability, and durability requirements
R-RAM-001 (Practice-session reliability)
The system shall operate reliably for an entire practice session without requiring frequent user intervention to restore normal function.
R-RAM-002 (Maintenance accessibility)
The system shall allow routine maintenance tasks (cleaning, inspection, simple adjustments) using common tools and without specialized equipment.
R-RAM-003 (Dust/weather considerations)
The design shall explicitly address environmental failure risks (dirt, weather exposure) through protective design and maintainable interfaces.
R-RAM-004 (Wear and deformation control)
The design shall control wear and deformation of high-use components such that performance remains within specified tolerances over the intended service life.
8) Verification-oriented requirements
R-VER-001 (Accuracy verification)
The system shall be verifiable by a test demonstrating the ability to deliver balls to selected target sub-regions after setup/calibration.
R-VER-002 (Repeatability verification)
The system shall be verifiable by a repeatability test that measures shot-to-shot variability under a controlled feed condition.
R-VER-003 (Variation verification)
The system shall be verifiable by demonstrating measurable variation in toss height, speed, and direction across a defined sequence.
R-VER-004 (Environmental verification)
The system shall be verifiable by an exposure/ingress test representative of dust/dirt and light weather conditions expected during typical practice use.
R-VER-005 (Portability verification)
The system shall be verifiable by demonstrating transport, setup, and stow operations by a single person using only integrated handling features.
