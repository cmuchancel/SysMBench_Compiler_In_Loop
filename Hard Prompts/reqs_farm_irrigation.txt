MBSE Pretend Requirements — River-to-Farm Irrigation Lift
Pretend-but-plausible requirements set for an MBSE effort to move river water up 30 ft to irrigate farmland at ≥ 20 GPM in a rural installation, deliverable within ~6 months, using simple controls.
1) Mission and scope requirements
R-MSN-001 (Purpose)
The system shall lift and deliver river water to the farm’s irrigation inlet for routine agricultural irrigation use.
R-MSN-002 (Operating environment)
The system shall be deployable and operable in a rural outdoor environment with exposure to rain, dust, mud, insects, and seasonal temperature swings.
R-MSN-003 (Schedule constraint)
The system shall be designed, procured, installed, and commissioned within 6 months from project start.
R-MSN-004 (User profile)
The system shall be operable and maintainable by farm personnel with basic mechanical/electrical skills and common hand tools.
2) Performance requirements
R-PERF-001 (Static lift / head)
The system shall lift water from the river water surface to the farm delivery point with a minimum static elevation gain of
30 ft
.
R-PERF-002 (Flow rate)
The system shall deliver a minimum steady-state flow of
20 gallons per minute (GPM)
at the farm delivery point.
R-PERF-003 (Continuous operation)
The system shall support continuous operation for at least
8 hours/day
during irrigation season without mandatory cool-down periods.
R-PERF-004 (Flow control simplicity)
The system shall provide a means to start/stop flow and to adjust flow in a coarse manner (e.g., on/off plus one adjustable valve), without requiring advanced automation.
R-PERF-005 (Prime and restart)
The system shall be capable of restarting after an intentional shutdown without requiring specialized priming equipment beyond built-in valves/check valves or a simple manual prime.
3) Interfaces and boundary requirements
R-INT-001 (Water source interface)
The system shall intake water from the river without requiring permanent alteration of the riverbank beyond small-scale civil works (e.g., an anchored intake, riprap, small pad).
R-INT-002 (Water delivery interface)
The system shall output water through a standard farm-compatible connection (e.g., a pipe outlet or hose coupling) suitable for connection to irrigation piping or a holding tank.
R-INT-003 (Electrical power availability)
The system shall operate from available electrical power; no constraint is placed on power availability (“unlimited power” assumption), but the design shall include standard electrical protection and disconnect.
R-INT-004 (Civil works allowance)
The design may include concrete foundations, pads, or protective structures as required for stability, mounting, and erosion control.
4) Control and autonomy constraints (explicitly “not sophisticated”)
R-CTRL-001 (Control technology limitation)
The system shall not rely on advanced control and actuation technologies (e.g., complex PLC automation, robotic actuators, multi-sensor closed-loop control).
Acceptable control mechanisms include manual switches, basic starters, simple float switch cutoff, basic pressure switch, and manual valves.
R-CTRL-002 (Local control)
The system shall include local controls at the pump/power unit for start/stop and emergency stop.
R-CTRL-003 (Status indication)
The system shall provide simple status indication (e.g., power on, pump running, fault/trip) using basic indicator lights or a single meter.
5) Reliability, availability, and maintainability
R-RAM-001 (Availability goal)
During irrigation season, the system shall achieve
≥ 95% availability
during planned operating hours (excluding scheduled maintenance).
R-RAM-002 (Maintainability)
Routine maintenance tasks (filter/strainer cleaning, visual inspection, lubrication if needed) shall be accomplishable in
≤ 30 minutes
per occurrence.
R-RAM-003 (Spare parts strategy)
Wear items (seals, strainer screens, common valves, fuses/breakers) shall be commercially available and replaceable without specialty tooling.
R-RAM-004 (Clog tolerance)
The system shall include intake protection (e.g., screened intake/strainer) and shall be tolerant of typical river debris (leaves, small sticks, sediment) without catastrophic damage.
6) Safety requirements
R-SAFE-001 (Electrical safety)
The system shall include a lockable disconnect and overcurrent protection consistent with rural outdoor installation practices (e.g., NEMA-rated enclosure, GFCI where appropriate).
R-SAFE-002 (Mechanical safety)
Rotating components (couplings, belts if used) shall be guarded to prevent inadvertent contact during operation.
R-SAFE-003 (Overpressure protection)
The system shall prevent damaging overpressure events in the discharge line via at least one protective measure (e.g., relief valve, pressure switch trip, or designed pressure rating margin).
R-SAFE-004 (Dry-run protection)
The system shall include a simple means to avoid pump damage from dry running (e.g., low-water cutoff float switch at intake or a basic pressure/flow interlock).
7) Environmental and regulatory considerations (generic, MBSE-friendly)
R-ENV-001 (Spill/leak containment)
If lubricants or fuels are used (only if a generator concept is considered), the system shall include provisions to minimize environmental release (drip pans/secondary containment).
If grid power is guaranteed, you can drop this requirement.
R-ENV-002 (Erosion control)
Any riverbank installation shall include erosion mitigation appropriate to expected seasonal flows (e.g., anchored intake, riprap, stable pad).
R-ENV-003 (Noise)
The system shall not exceed a reasonable rural nuisance threshold at the farmstead boundary (define locally if needed), and shall include muffling/isolators if applicable.
8) Verification-oriented requirements (good for MBSE)
R-VER-001 (Flow verification)
The delivered flow rate shall be verifiable with a simple field test (e.g., timed fill of a known-volume container or an inline mechanical flow meter).
R-VER-002 (Head verification)
The elevation gain shall be verifiable by survey/measurement of intake and delivery elevation, plus pressure measurement at delivery (if used).
R-VER-003 (Acceptance test)
The system shall pass an acceptance test demonstrating ≥ 20 GPM delivery at 30 ft lift for a continuous
2-hour
run under typical conditions.
