During normal lifting motion, the system shall add negligible resistance such that users perceive the lift as substantially similar to unassisted free weights. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
R-PERF-004 (Engagement response)
Upon user safety engagement, the system shall arrest motion within a short travel interval sufficient to prevent injury, consistent with discrete engagement behavior described in the analysis assumptions. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
R-PERF-005 (High-cycle operation)

4) Key constraints
R-CNST-001 (Ease of use)
The system shall be simple and intuitive to operate such that users would be willing to use it in routine workouts. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
R-CNST-002 (Reliability emphasis)
The system shall prioritize reliability as a safety-critical feature, with consistent behavior across users and sessions. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
R-CNST-003 (Cost sensitivity)
