Pretend MBSE Requirements — Assistive Sit-to-Stand Wheelchair Add-on
Requirements and constraints for a device that assists a wheelchair user in transferring from sitting to standing,
        emphasizing independence, stability, simplicity of operation, and practical manufacturability.
1) Mission and scope requirements
R-MSN-001 (Primary function)

R-MSN-002 (Use contexts)
The system shall support use in home and care-facility environments, enabling frequent transfers throughout a typical day.
R-MSN-003 (Independence objective)
The system shall support independent use by the intended user without requiring a high-strength assistant for normal operation.
R-MSN-004 (Integration objective)
The system shall be compatible with a standard manual wheelchair form factor and shall not prevent normal wheelchair mobility when not transferring.
R-MSN-005 (Portability objective)
The system shall remain usable by a wheelchair-bound person without requiring external setup equipment beyond what is integrated on the chair.
2) Functional performance requirements
R-PERF-001 (Transfer motion)
The system shall create a controlled transfer motion that supports moving the user’s center of mass toward a stable standing posture.
R-PERF-002 (Assistive action at seat)
The system shall apply an assistive action to the seat region to provide a helping effect during transfer, reducing required user effort.
R-PERF-003 (Minimum transfer angle)
The system shall enable a seat/transfer interface rotation of at least
45 degrees
from horizontal during the assist phase.
R-PERF-004 (Assistive force capability)
The system shall be capable of providing an assistive force during motion sufficient to materially reduce the user’s required standing effort.
R-PERF-005 (Speed of use)
The system shall complete the assistive transfer motion within a time duration that is practical for routine daily use and competitive with existing approaches.
R-PERF-006 (Repeatability)
The system shall provide repeatable transfer behavior across repeated cycles without requiring recalibration between normal uses.
3) Key constraints
R-CNST-001 (Load capacity)
The system shall support a minimum user load of
185 lb
during transfer operations.
R-CNST-002 (Added push burden)
The system shall add no more than
40 N
of additional push effort compared to the baseline wheelchair during typical rolling movement.
R-CNST-003 (Packaging envelope)
The system shall fit within an available wheelchair integration envelope with maximum added dimensions not exceeding
18 inches
in any single direction beyond allowable integration boundaries.
R-CNST-004 (Standing-moment contribution)
The system shall provide more than
50%
of the standing moment required during the transfer, relative to an unassisted transfer.
R-CNST-005 (Cost constraint)
The system shall be designed with low cost as a primary constraint, suitable for broad accessibility across individual users and facilities.
R-CNST-006 (Simplicity constraint)
The system shall be simple and easy to use, avoiding complex setup steps and minimizing required user training.
4) Interfaces and compatibility requirements
R-INT-001 (Wheelchair structural interface)
The system shall attach to or integrate with the wheelchair structure without compromising the wheelchair’s structural integrity during normal mobility and during transfer.
R-INT-002 (User interface)
The system shall include an intuitive user control interface that can be operated by low-strength users while seated.
R-INT-003 (Power interface)
The system shall include a defined power interface suitable for the intended deployment environment(s) and shall ensure safe electrical connections and protection.
R-INT-004 (Mobility compatibility)
The system shall not obstruct wheels, hand rims, brakes, footrests, or other essential mobility and access features of the wheelchair.
5) Safety and assurance requirements
R-SAFE-001 (Stability and confidence)
The system shall maintain user stability throughout the assist cycle and shall not introduce tipping or unsafe oscillation under expected use conditions.
R-SAFE-002 (Structural factor of safety)
Load-bearing structural elements shall meet a minimum factor of safety of
4.5
under specified worst-case operating loads.
R-SAFE-003 (Controlled motion)
The system shall provide controlled motion during transfer, including the ability to stop the motion safely if needed.
R-SAFE-004 (Fail-safe behavior)
In the event of loss of power or a detected fault, the system shall transition to a safe state that prevents uncontrolled motion and maintains user safety.
R-SAFE-005 (Pinch/entrapment protection)
The system shall minimize pinch points and entrapment hazards for the user and nearby caregivers during operation.
6) Reliability, maintainability, and lifecycle requirements
R-RAM-001 (Durability)
The system shall withstand repeated daily transfer cycles over its intended service life without loss of function.
R-RAM-002 (Maintainability)
The system shall allow routine inspection and maintenance with commonly available tools and without specialized equipment.
R-RAM-003 (Serviceability)
Replaceable wear components (if any) shall be replaceable without requiring disassembly of major wheelchair elements.
R-RAM-004 (Cleanability)
Surfaces in user contact areas shall be cleanable, and soft goods (if present) shall be removable or otherwise maintainable for hygiene.
7) Verification and validation requirements
R-VER-001 (Functional demonstration)
The system shall be verifiable by demonstrating a complete assisted transfer from seated to standing for the minimum user load.
R-VER-002 (Angle verification)
The system shall be verifiable by measuring that the transfer interface achieves at least 45 degrees during operation.
R-VER-003 (Stability verification)
The system shall be verifiable by testing that stability is maintained throughout the transfer under expected user motions and operating conditions.
R-VER-004 (Structural verification)
The system shall be verifiable through analysis and/or test that the minimum factor of safety requirement is met for load-bearing components.
R-VER-005 (Usability validation)
The system shall be validated via user trials demonstrating that intended users can understand and operate the controls after minimal instruction.
