Pretend MBSE Requirements — Automatic Door Opening Assist (Retrofit)
Solution-agnostic requirements and constraints intended to drive MBSE functional decomposition and concept exploration
        for a retrofit system that enables automatic opening of existing interior doors to improve accessibility.
1) Mission and scope requirements
R-MSN-001 (Primary function)
The system shall enable an interior hinged door to open automatically for an accessibility user when requested.
R-MSN-002 (Retrofit scope)
The system shall be designed as an add-on for existing doors that already use traditional door-closer hardware.
R-MSN-003 (Deployment context)
The system shall be suitable for installation on a large number of doors in an institutional campus setting (e.g., classroom doors), not just exterior entrances.
R-MSN-004 (Independence objective)
The system shall improve user independence by reducing reliance on assistance from other people for routine door access.
2) Top-level functional requirements
R-FUNC-001 (Initiate automatic opening)
The system shall provide a user-initiated means to request automatic opening without requiring the user to manipulate a door knob.
R-FUNC-002 (Preferred initiation modality)
The primary initiation interface shall be compatible with push-button actuation appropriate for accessibility users.
R-FUNC-003 (Door opening against existing resistance)
The system shall open the door against the resistance of the existing door closer and typical hinge/friction loads.
R-FUNC-004 (Hold-ready state)
The system shall support a “ready” state in which it is prepared to perform an opening upon request, without unintended actuation.
R-FUNC-005 (Non-interference during closing)
The system shall not impede or materially increase resistance during normal door closing under the door closer.
R-FUNC-006 (Directionality)
The system shall ensure that the automatic opening motion occurs in the intended opening direction and does not reverse the door’s expected behavior.
R-FUNC-007 (Reset/return to standby)
After completing an opening cycle (or after a cancellation), the system shall return to a defined standby state suitable for subsequent use.
3) Performance requirements (measurable targets)
R-PERF-001 (Opening capability baseline)
The system shall be capable of opening doors with an opening force requirement up to at least
11.375 lbf
(representative campus door measurement).
R-PERF-002 (Full-open completion)
The system shall open the door to a usable open position sufficient for wheelchair passage under normal operating conditions.
R-PERF-003 (Cycle response)
Upon user request, the system shall begin the opening action within a short, user-acceptable delay and proceed with controlled motion.
R-PERF-004 (Repeatability)
The system shall provide repeatable opening performance across repeated cycles without requiring re-adjustment between typical uses.
4) Key constraints
R-CNST-001 (Cost constraint)
The system shall be designed to be lower-cost than typical electrically-driven automatic door operators, suitable for scaling across many doors.
R-CNST-002 (Installation burden)
The system shall be installable without requiring specialized high-skill labor for each door installation, supporting scalable deployment.
R-CNST-003 (Door hardware compatibility)
The system shall be compatible with common door closer interface geometries and shall tolerate variation in existing door hardware across buildings.
R-CNST-004 (Operational simplicity)
The system shall be simple and intuitive for both accessibility users and general building occupants, minimizing the need for training.
R-CNST-005 (Packaging/enclosure)
The system shall fit within a practical on-door or near-door packaging envelope and shall include an enclosure appropriate for building environments.
5) Safety and assurance requirements
R-SAFE-001 (Controlled motion)
The system shall provide controlled door motion such that the opening action does not create unsafe rapid movement for nearby pedestrians.
R-SAFE-002 (User protection)
The system shall prevent user contact with hazardous moving elements during normal operation and typical interaction.
R-SAFE-003 (Fail-safe behavior)
In the presence of a fault, jam, or abnormal operating condition, the system shall transition to a safe state that avoids uncontrolled door motion.
R-SAFE-004 (Pinch/entrapment mitigation)
The system shall minimize pinch points and entrapment hazards introduced by the add-on mechanism.
6) Reliability, maintainability, and durability requirements
R-RAM-001 (High-cycle use)
The system shall withstand frequent daily use in a public building environment without loss of function.
R-RAM-002 (Hold/standby durability)
The system shall maintain its readiness/standby condition for extended periods without unintended actuation or loss of ability to operate when requested.
R-RAM-003 (Serviceability)
The system shall allow inspection and maintenance using common tools, and replaceable wear items shall be accessible.
R-RAM-004 (Environmental robustness)
The system shall operate reliably under typical indoor building conditions including dust, incidental impacts, and temperature variation within conditioned spaces.
7) Verification-oriented requirements
R-VER-001 (Opening-force verification)
The opening capability shall be verifiable by test on representative doors spanning measured opening force requirements up to the specified baseline.
R-VER-002 (Non-interference verification)
Non-interference during door closing shall be verifiable by comparing closing behavior (time/effort) with and without the installed system.
R-VER-003 (Repeatability verification)
Repeatability shall be verifiable by conducting a multi-cycle endurance test demonstrating consistent operation across repeated open/close cycles.
R-VER-004 (Safety verification)
Safe-state behavior shall be verifiable by induced fault/jam scenarios demonstrating controlled stop and absence of hazardous motion.
